  "summary": "The simulation model for the epidemic needs critical improvements in logic and performance to ensure accurate and efficient results. Key issues include incorrect calculations for metrics and inefficient processing of interactions, which are crucial for the model's validity. Enhancing these aspects will improve the simulation's alignment with expected epidemic dynamics and enable better decision-making.",
