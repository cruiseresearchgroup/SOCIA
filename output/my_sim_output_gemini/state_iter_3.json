It also includes basic input validation for parameters and performs simple checks for population conservation and epidemic extinction, directly addressing some of the validation criteria. The code is well-structured, readable, and includes comments. Its correctness relies heavily on the functionality of the imported custom modules (`Simulation`, `Person`, `Environment`, `MetricsTracker`) which were not provided for review.
