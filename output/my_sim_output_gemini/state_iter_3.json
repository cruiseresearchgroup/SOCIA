For each infected agent:\n   - Execute the 'potentially_recover' behavior's algorithm. If it results in recovery, add the agent to `agents_to_recover`.\n   (Ensure an agent is not added multiple times).\n4. **Apply State Changes:** Iterate through `agents_to_infect`. If an agent is currently 'Susceptible', change its status to 'Infected'. Iterate through `agents_to_recover`. If an agent is currently 'Infected', change its status to 'Recovered'.\n5. **Update Metrics:** Recalculate the counts of Susceptible, Infected, and Recovered agents. Update the cumulative 'total_infections' (this metric counts how many *unique* individuals have entered the 'Infected' state at any point; typically, this is the initial infected count plus the number of Susceptibles who became Infected).\n6.
