  "summary": "The provided `main.py` script serves as a robust orchestrator for the simple epidemic simulation. It correctly handles configuration loading, simulation setup, execution loop, metric collection, basic validation, and visualization. The code is well-structured, readable, and follows standard Python practices. It relies heavily on external modules (`config`, `utils`, `person`, `simulation_env`, `metrics`) which are assumed to be correctly implemented.",
  "issues": [],
  "suggestions": [
    {
      "description": "Consider adding more explicit error handling, for example, around loading the configuration or initializing external components, to make the script more resilient to potential failures.",
      "reason": "Adding `try...except` blocks can gracefully handle issues like missing configuration files or errors during module initialization, preventing unexpected crashes."
    },
    {
      "description": "Review imports and remove any modules or objects (like `Person` and `get_random_float`) that are imported but not directly used within the `main.py` file. They might be used by the imported modules (`simulation_env`, `utils`), but importing them here when not directly called adds unnecessary clutter.",
      "reason": "Keeping imports clean and minimal improves code readability and clarity by showing only the direct dependencies of the file."
    },
    {
      "description": "While the main validation checks are noted, adding assertions for basic data integrity within the collected metrics (e.g., ensuring counts are non-negative) could provide an extra layer of confidence, even if the primary validation logic resides elsewhere.",
      "reason": "Basic data checks can help catch unexpected issues in the simulation output early."
