  "reason": "The current iteration's simulation code is functional and passed verification with only minor issues. However, the evaluation highlights significant gaps in model realism compared to real-world dynamics, particularly the lack of spatial structure and detailed agent behaviors. The feedback identifies these as critical issues and provides clear, high-priority model improvements (implementing a spatial model, enhancing agent behaviors) that have the potential for significant improvement in the next iteration. We are currently at Iteration 2 of 3, leaving one iteration to address these critical shortcomings and attempt to improve model accuracy.",
