Starting with 1 infected individual in a population of 1000, the virus spread through the population. The simulation tracked the counts of susceptible, infected, and recovered individuals at each step. At the conclusion of the simulation (step 100), 900 individuals had been infected at least once. The population consisted of 100 susceptible, 3 currently infected, and 897 recovered individuals. A visualization showing the state counts over time was generated."
