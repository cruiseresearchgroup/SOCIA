  "summary": "The provided `main.py` script serves as the entry point for the epidemic simulation. It correctly sets up simulation parameters based on the task specification, initializes and runs the simulation (assuming the imported `Simulation` class is correctly implemented), retrieves metrics, and visualizes the key results (SIR curves and cumulative infections) using Matplotlib. It also includes basic input validation for parameters and performs simple checks for population conservation and epidemic extinction, directly addressing some of the validation criteria. The code is well-structured, readable, and includes comments. Its correctness relies heavily on the functionality of the imported custom modules (`Simulation`, `Person`, `Environment`, `MetricsTracker`) which were not provided for review. Overall, `main.py` is a well-implemented driver script for the simulation.",
  "issues": [
    {
      "type": "style",
      "severity": "low",
      "description": "Several modules (`Person`, `Environment`, `MetricsTracker`) are imported but not directly used within the `main` function or elsewhere in `main.py`. While they are likely used by the `Simulation` class, importing them here is unnecessary and slightly clutters the import list.",
      "location": "main.py: lines 4-6",
      "solution": "Remove the unused import statements: `from agent import Person`, `from environment import Environment`, `from metrics import MetricsTracker`."

  "suggestions": [
    {
      "description": "Implement more sophisticated automated validation checks based on the task specification's validation criteria, such as analyzing the shape of the SIR curves (e.g., checking for a peak in infected count) or facilitating sensitivity testing with different parameters (e.g., by running the simulation multiple times with varying inputs).",
      "reason": "The task specification lists 'sir_curve_shape' and 'parameter_sensitivity' as validation criteria. While the script generates plots that allow *manual* validation, automated checks would make the validation process more rigorous and reproducible and align better with the 'validation_criteria' section of the spec."
    },
    {
      "description": "Consider making simulation parameters (especially `simulation_steps` and `random_seed`) configurable via command-line arguments or a configuration file instead of hardcoding them.",
      "reason": "This would make the script more flexible and easier to use for running multiple experiments, varying simulation length, or controlling reproducibility without modifying the code directly."
    },
    {
      "description": "Add basic error handling around the plotting section (e.g., a try-except block) in case the `metrics` dictionary returned by `simulation.get_metrics()` is empty, missing expected keys, or has incorrectly formatted data.",
      "reason": "This would make the script more robust against potential issues originating from the `Simulation` class's output."
