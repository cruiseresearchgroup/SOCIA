Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
            "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",
            "Data Calibration Procedure": "To calibrate the simulator using real data: Randomly select multiple residents for calibration; Randomly select a specific date for a given resident; Use the simulator to generate the predicted trajectory for that date; Compare the generated trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory for the same day; Compute evaluation metrics (e.g., JSD, step distance, step interval). Then, improve the simulator\u2019s performance by refining the following types of prompts: 1. The prompt used to extract representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from historical trajectories; 2. The prompt used to infer the resident\u2019s Persona from their behavioral history; 3. The prompt used to summarize the current day\u2019s Motivation from recent behavior. Through this iterative loop of data calibration and prompt refinement, the simulator is progressively optimized to produce more accurate and realistic mobility simulations.",
            "Simulator Design Requirements": "You are to design a simulator capable of generating daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The simulator must: 1. Data loading: Load data that records the daily activity trajectories of residents; 2. Pattern & Persona Initialization: For each resident, generate and store their Pattern and Persona based on the resident's historical data; 3. Data sampling: From the daily activity trajectories of residents, randomly sample residents and the resident's certain daily mobility trajectories as the validation data; 4. Daily Trajectory Prediction: When predicting a resident\u2019s trajectory (from the validation data) on a particular day: Use their behavior over the past 7 days to generate the Motivation for that day; Use the resident\u2019s Pattern, Persona, and Motivation together as a prompt to the LLM; The LLM then generates a logical daily trajectory in JSON format, including arrival times and reasons for visiting each location. Using this generated logical daily trajectory to compare with the ground-truth trajectory to validate the simulator",
            "Input-Output Mapping of the Simulated Agent Framework": "Input: The user\u2019s historical trajectory data prior to the target date (up to the past 7 days); A contextual prompt for the target date (optional, e.g., a pandemic-related cue; if not provided, leave blank). Output (Simulated Results): A full-day activity trajectory for the target date (structured as time + POI); An explanation of the behavioral motivation (optional). These outputs are compared against the real-world data, and the generation quality is evaluated using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the step distance (SD) and step interval (DI) distributions."

Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

          "description": "I am now tasked with designing a social simulator. The simulator's goal is to simulate the daily activity trajectories of urban residents. Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

          "description": "I am now tasked with designing a social simulator. The simulator's goal is to simulate the daily activity trajectories of urban residents. Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",
