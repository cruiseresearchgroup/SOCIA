The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home.

This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory.

            "Data Calibration Procedure": "To calibrate the simulator using real data: Randomly select multiple residents for calibration; Randomly select a specific date for a given resident; Use the simulator to generate the predicted trajectory for that date; Compare the generated trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory for the same day; Compute evaluation metrics (e.g., JSD, step distance, step interval). Then, improve the simulator\u2019s performance by refining the following types of prompts: 1. The prompt used to extract representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from historical trajectories; 2. The prompt used to infer the resident\u2019s Persona from their behavioral history; 3. The prompt used to summarize the current day\u2019s Motivation from recent behavior. Through this iterative loop of data calibration and prompt refinement, the simulator is progressively optimized to produce more accurate and realistic mobility simulations.",
            "Simulator Design Requirements": "You are to design a simulator capable of generating daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The simulator must: 1. Data loading: Load data that records the daily activity trajectories of residents; 2. Pattern & Persona Initialization: For each resident, generate and store their Pattern and Persona based on the resident's historical data; 3. Data sampling: From the daily activity trajectories of residents, randomly sample residents and the resident's certain daily mobility trajectories as the validation data; 4. Daily Trajectory Prediction: When predicting a resident\u2019s trajectory (from the validation data) on a particular day: Use their behavior over the past 7 days to generate the Motivation for that day; Use the resident\u2019s Pattern, Persona, and Motivation together as a prompt to the LLM; The LLM then generates a logical daily trajectory in JSON format, including arrival times and reasons for visiting each location. Using this generated logical daily trajectory to compare with the ground-truth trajectory to validate the simulator",
            "Input-Output Mapping of the Simulated Agent Framework": "Input: The user\u2019s historical trajectory data prior to the target date (up to the past 7 days); A contextual prompt for the target date (optional, e.g., a pandemic-related cue; if not provided, leave blank). Output (Simulated Results): A full-day activity trajectory for the target date (structured as time + POI); An explanation of the behavioral motivation (optional). These outputs are compared against the real-world data, and the generation quality is evaluated using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the step distance (SD) and step interval (DI) distributions."

Here's a concise semantic metadata summary in the context of designing a social simulator:\n\n- **Overall Data Structure and Type**: The file contains a simple JSON object composed of key-value pairs. Each key represents a specific type of location within an urban environment, and each value represents the broader category or purpose associated with that location.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns**: The keys in this JSON file are names of specific locations (e.g., \"Train Station\", \"Police Station\", \"Shrine\"). These represent potential destinations or points of interest that urban residents might visit during their daily activities.\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements**: There are no nested elements or complex relationships within this JSON file. Each location is directly mapped to a single category, which helps classify the nature of activities that typically occur at these locations.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions**: In the context of the social simulator, this data can be used to categorize different locations that residents might visit. These categories can help simulate realistic daily activity patterns by associating specific times or sequences with relevant categories. For example, a \"Train Station\" might be associated with peak travel times, whereas a \"Convenience Store\" could have frequent visits throughout the day. The categories can inform the likelihood and timing of visits to these locations, helping to create varied and realistic trajectories for urban residents in the simulation.",

          "### Semantic Metadata Summary\n\n**Overall Data Structure and Type:**\n- The data is structured in JSON format, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.\n- The JSON file contains a collection of records, each associated with a unique identifier.\n\n**Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n- Each key at the top level represents a unique identifier for an individual, presumably representing different urban residents. These identifiers are numeric strings, such as \"1874\", \"1032\", \"1531\", \"5765\", \"4007\", etc.\n- The value associated with each individual key is an array of strings. Each string describes a day's worth of activities and locations visited by that individual.\n\n**Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n- Each string within the array for an individual follows a specific pattern: \"Activities at [date]: [Location#ID] at [time], ...\" which lists a sequence of location-time pairs representing the trajectory of an individual's daily activities.\n- The locations are described as named places with unique identifiers (e.g., \"Convenience Store#2420\"), and the time denotes when the individual was at that location (e.g., \"at 11:30:00\").\n- The sequence of locations signifies the order of visits, indicating a temporal relationship between the locations visited by the individual on that day.\n\n**How this Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n- **Entities:** Each unique identifier represents an entity in the simulation, corresponding to an urban resident. These entities have attributes such as daily activity trajectories, which include a sequence of location-time pairs.\n- **Interactions:** The data provides a basis for simulating the movement and activity patterns of these urban residents. The interactions among entities can be modeled by examining co-located individuals at similar times, simulating social interactions or shared activities.\n- **Simulation Trajectories:** The ordered location-time pairs allow the simulation to replicate realistic daily patterns of movement and activity, helping to understand urban dynamics, such as traffic flow, peak times at certain venues, and potential social gatherings.\n- **Temporal Analysis:** The timestamps provide a temporal dimension to the simulation, allowing analysis of peak times and duration of visits at specific locations, aiding in urban planning and resource allocation.\n\nOverall, the JSON data is crucial for developing a detailed and realistic social simulator that captures the complexity of urban life by modeling the daily activity trajectories of individual residents."

Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

Each key represents a specific type of location within an urban environment, and each value represents the broader category or purpose associated with that location.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns**: The keys in this JSON file are names of specific locations (e.g., \"Train Station\", \"Police Station\", \"Shrine\"). These represent potential destinations or points of interest that urban residents might visit during their daily activities.\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements**: There are no nested elements or complex relationships within this JSON file. Each location is directly mapped to a single category, which helps classify the nature of activities that typically occur at these locations.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions**: In the context of the social simulator, this data can be used to categorize different locations that residents might visit. These categories can help simulate realistic daily activity patterns by associating specific times or sequences with relevant categories. For example, a \"Train Station\" might be associated with peak travel times, whereas a \"Convenience Store\" could have frequent visits throughout the day. The categories can inform the likelihood and timing of visits to these locations, helping to create varied and realistic trajectories for urban residents in the simulation.",

These identifiers are numeric strings, such as \"1874\", \"1032\", \"1531\", \"5765\", \"4007\", etc.\n- The value associated with each individual key is an array of strings. Each string describes a day's worth of activities and locations visited by that individual.\n\n**Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n- Each string within the array for an individual follows a specific pattern: \"Activities at [date]: [Location#ID] at [time], ...\" which lists a sequence of location-time pairs representing the trajectory of an individual's daily activities.\n- The locations are described as named places with unique identifiers (e.g., \"Convenience Store#2420\"), and the time denotes when the individual was at that location (e.g., \"at 11:30:00\").\n- The sequence of locations signifies the order of visits, indicating a temporal relationship between the locations visited by the individual on that day.\n\n**How this Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n- **Entities:** Each unique identifier represents an entity in the simulation, corresponding to an urban resident. These entities have attributes such as daily activity trajectories, which include a sequence of location-time pairs.\n- **Interactions:** The data provides a basis for simulating the movement and activity patterns of these urban residents. The interactions among entities can be modeled by examining co-located individuals at similar times, simulating social interactions or shared activities.\n- **Simulation Trajectories:** The ordered location-time pairs allow the simulation to replicate realistic daily patterns of movement and activity, helping to understand urban dynamics, such as traffic flow, peak times at certain venues, and potential social gatherings.\n- **Temporal Analysis:** The timestamps provide a temporal dimension to the simulation, allowing analysis of peak times and duration of visits at specific locations, aiding in urban planning and resource allocation.\n\nOverall, the JSON data is crucial for developing a detailed and realistic social simulator that captures the complexity of urban life by modeling the daily activity trajectories of individual residents."

Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

Here's a concise semantic metadata summary in the context of designing a social simulator:\n\n- **Overall Data Structure and Type**: The file contains a simple JSON object composed of key-value pairs. Each key represents a specific type of location within an urban environment, and each value represents the broader category or purpose associated with that location.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns**: The keys in this JSON file are names of specific locations (e.g., \"Train Station\", \"Police Station\", \"Shrine\"). These represent potential destinations or points of interest that urban residents might visit during their daily activities.\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements**: There are no nested elements or complex relationships within this JSON file. Each location is directly mapped to a single category, which helps classify the nature of activities that typically occur at these locations.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions**: In the context of the social simulator, this data can be used to categorize different locations that residents might visit. These categories can help simulate realistic daily activity patterns by associating specific times or sequences with relevant categories. For example, a \"Train Station\" might be associated with peak travel times, whereas a \"Convenience Store\" could have frequent visits throughout the day. The categories can inform the likelihood and timing of visits to these locations, helping to create varied and realistic trajectories for urban residents in the simulation.",

These identifiers are numeric strings, such as \"1874\", \"1032\", \"1531\", \"5765\", \"4007\", etc.\n- The value associated with each individual key is an array of strings. Each string describes a day's worth of activities and locations visited by that individual.\n\n**Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n- Each string within the array for an individual follows a specific pattern: \"Activities at [date]: [Location#ID] at [time], ...\" which lists a sequence of location-time pairs representing the trajectory of an individual's daily activities.\n- The locations are described as named places with unique identifiers (e.g., \"Convenience Store#2420\"), and the time denotes when the individual was at that location (e.g., \"at 11:30:00\").\n- The sequence of locations signifies the order of visits, indicating a temporal relationship between the locations visited by the individual on that day.\n\n**How this Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n- **Entities:** Each unique identifier represents an entity in the simulation, corresponding to an urban resident. These entities have attributes such as daily activity trajectories, which include a sequence of location-time pairs.\n- **Interactions:** The data provides a basis for simulating the movement and activity patterns of these urban residents. The interactions among entities can be modeled by examining co-located individuals at similar times, simulating social interactions or shared activities.\n- **Simulation Trajectories:** The ordered location-time pairs allow the simulation to replicate realistic daily patterns of movement and activity, helping to understand urban dynamics, such as traffic flow, peak times at certain venues, and potential social gatherings.\n- **Temporal Analysis:** The timestamps provide a temporal dimension to the simulation, allowing analysis of peak times and duration of visits at specific locations, aiding in urban planning and resource allocation.\n\nOverall, the JSON data is crucial for developing a detailed and realistic social simulator that captures the complexity of urban life by modeling the daily activity trajectories of individual residents."

Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

            "The file `catto.json` is a JSON-formatted data structure that maps specific urban locations to their corresponding categories of activities or purposes. Here's a concise semantic metadata summary in the context of designing a social simulator:\n\n- **Overall Data Structure and Type**: The file contains a simple JSON object composed of key-value pairs. Each key represents a specific type of location within an urban environment, and each value represents the broader category or purpose associated with that location.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns**: The keys in this JSON file are names of specific locations (e.g., \"Train Station\", \"Police Station\", \"Shrine\"). These represent potential destinations or points of interest that urban residents might visit during their daily activities.\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements**: There are no nested elements or complex relationships within this JSON file. Each location is directly mapped to a single category, which helps classify the nature of activities that typically occur at these locations.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions**: In the context of the social simulator, this data can be used to categorize different locations that residents might visit. These categories can help simulate realistic daily activity patterns by associating specific times or sequences with relevant categories. For example, a \"Train Station\" might be associated with peak travel times, whereas a \"Convenience Store\" could have frequent visits throughout the day. The categories can inform the likelihood and timing of visits to these locations, helping to create varied and realistic trajectories for urban residents in the simulation.",

            "### Semantic Metadata Summary\n\n**Overall Data Structure and Type:**\n- The data is structured in JSON format, which is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.\n- The JSON file contains a collection of records, each associated with a unique identifier.\n\n**Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n- Each key at the top level represents a unique identifier for an individual, presumably representing different urban residents. These identifiers are numeric strings, such as \"1874\", \"1032\", \"1531\", \"5765\", \"4007\", etc.\n- The value associated with each individual key is an array of strings. Each string describes a day's worth of activities and locations visited by that individual.\n\n**Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n- Each string within the array for an individual follows a specific pattern: \"Activities at [date]: [Location#ID] at [time], ...\" which lists a sequence of location-time pairs representing the trajectory of an individual's daily activities.\n- The locations are described as named places with unique identifiers (e.g., \"Convenience Store#2420\"), and the time denotes when the individual was at that location (e.g., \"at 11:30:00\").\n- The sequence of locations signifies the order of visits, indicating a temporal relationship between the locations visited by the individual on that day.\n\n**How this Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n- **Entities:** Each unique identifier represents an entity in the simulation, corresponding to an urban resident. These entities have attributes such as daily activity trajectories, which include a sequence of location-time pairs.\n- **Interactions:** The data provides a basis for simulating the movement and activity patterns of these urban residents. The interactions among entities can be modeled by examining co-located individuals at similar times, simulating social interactions or shared activities.\n- **Simulation Trajectories:** The ordered location-time pairs allow the simulation to replicate realistic daily patterns of movement and activity, helping to understand urban dynamics, such as traffic flow, peak times at certain venues, and potential social gatherings.\n- **Temporal Analysis:** The timestamps provide a temporal dimension to the simulation, allowing analysis of peak times and duration of visits at specific locations, aiding in urban planning and resource allocation.\n\nOverall, the JSON data is crucial for developing a detailed and realistic social simulator that captures the complexity of urban life by modeling the daily activity trajectories of individual residents."

Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

          "description": "I am now tasked with designing a social simulator. The simulator's goal is to simulate the daily activity trajectories of urban residents. Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",
