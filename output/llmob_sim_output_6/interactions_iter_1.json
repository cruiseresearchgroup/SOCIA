Then, improve the simulator\u2019s performance by refining the following types of prompts: 1. The prompt used to extract representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from historical trajectories; 2. The prompt used to infer the resident\u2019s Persona from their behavioral history; 3. The prompt used to summarize the current day\u2019s Motivation from recent behavior. Through this iterative loop of data calibration and prompt refinement, the simulator is progressively optimized to produce more accurate and realistic mobility simulations.",

Data loading: Load data that records the daily activity trajectories of residents; 2. Pattern & Persona Initialization: For each resident, generate and store their Pattern and Persona based on the resident's historical data; 3. Data sampling: From the daily activity trajectories of residents, randomly sample residents and the resident's certain daily mobility trajectories as the validation data; 4. Daily Trajectory Prediction: When predicting a resident\u2019s trajectory (from the validation data) on a particular day: Use their behavior over the past 7 days to generate the Motivation for that day; Use the resident\u2019s Pattern, Persona, and Motivation together as a prompt to the LLM; The LLM then generates a logical daily trajectory in JSON format, including arrival times and reasons for visiting each location. Using this generated logical daily trajectory to compare with the ground-truth trajectory to validate the simulator",

Output (Simulated Results): A full-day activity trajectory for the target date (structured as time + POI); An explanation of the behavioral motivation (optional). These outputs are compared against the real-world data, and the generation quality is evaluated using the Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) between the step distance (SD) and step interval (DI) distributions."

The data is organized as a dictionary, where each entry consists of a key-value pair.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n  In this JSON file, the keys represent specific locations found within an urban environment. These are identifiable places that individuals might visit during their daily activities, such as \"Train Station,\" \"Police Station,\" \"Shrine,\" \"City,\" and \"Convenience Store.\"\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n  The values corresponding to each key represent the category of the location. These categories provide context about the nature or primary function of each location. For instance, \"Train Station\" falls under the category \"Travel & Transport,\" indicating its role in facilitating movement and commuting. There are no nested elements in this data structure; each location is directly associated with a single category.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n  In the context of designing a social simulator, this data can be used to define the types of locations individuals might visit as part of their daily activity trajectories. Each location type can be associated with specific activities or interactions, influencing the behavior and decisions of the simulated urban residents. For example:\n  - **Travel & Transport:** Locations like \"Train Station\" may serve as nodes for transitioning between different areas of the city.\n  - **Professional & Other Places:** Locations such as \"Police Station\" and \"Shrine\" may be associated with work-related visits or cultural activities.\n  - **Outdoors & Recreation:** \"City\" can be a general area for various outdoor activities or leisure.\n  - **Shop & Service:** \"Convenience Store\" might represent quick stops for purchasing goods.\n\n  By categorizing locations, the simulator can generate realistic and varied daily trajectories, capturing the diversity of urban life and the interactions between residents and their environment.",

Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

The data is organized as a dictionary, where each entry consists of a key-value pair.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n  In this JSON file, the keys represent specific locations found within an urban environment. These are identifiable places that individuals might visit during their daily activities, such as \"Train Station,\" \"Police Station,\" \"Shrine,\" \"City,\" and \"Convenience Store.\"\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n  The values corresponding to each key represent the category of the location. These categories provide context about the nature or primary function of each location. For instance, \"Train Station\" falls under the category \"Travel & Transport,\" indicating its role in facilitating movement and commuting. There are no nested elements in this data structure; each location is directly associated with a single category.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n  In the context of designing a social simulator, this data can be used to define the types of locations individuals might visit as part of their daily activity trajectories. Each location type can be associated with specific activities or interactions, influencing the behavior and decisions of the simulated urban residents. For example:\n  - **Travel & Transport:** Locations like \"Train Station\" may serve as nodes for transitioning between different areas of the city.\n  - **Professional & Other Places:** Locations such as \"Police Station\" and \"Shrine\" may be associated with work-related visits or cultural activities.\n  - **Outdoors & Recreation:** \"City\" can be a general area for various outdoor activities or leisure.\n  - **Shop & Service:** \"Convenience Store\" might represent quick stops for purchasing goods.\n\n  By categorizing locations, the simulator can generate realistic and varied daily trajectories, capturing the diversity of urban life and the interactions between residents and their environment.",

            "**Semantic Metadata Summary:**\n\n- **Overall Data Structure and Type:**\n  - The data is structured as a JSON file, where the root is an object containing key-value pairs.\n  - Each key is a unique identifier representing an individual urban resident, and the associated value is a list of strings detailing their activities.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n  - Keys: Unique identifiers for each individual resident (e.g., \"1874\", \"1032\"). These serve as primary identifiers for residents within the simulation.\n  - Values: Lists of strings, where each string represents a daily activity log for the individual. Each log contains a date, followed by a sequence of location-time pairs indicating places visited and the respective times.\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n  - Each individual's activity log is a list of daily records. Each record is a string that includes:\n    - A date (e.g., \"2019-01-09\") which indicates the specific day of activities.\n    - A sequence of activities formatted as \"LocationName#LocationID at Time\" (e.g., \"Rest Area#1120 at 10:50:00\"), indicating the places visited and times of visit.\n  - The data is inherently temporal and spatial, capturing both the temporal order of activities and the spatial locations visited by residents.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n  - **Simulation Entities:**\n    - Residents: Each key represents a simulation entity (an urban resident) with distinct daily activity patterns.\n    - Locations: Extract and categorize locations from the activity logs to create a database of places within the simulation environment.\n    - Time: Use timestamps to simulate the temporal aspect of daily activities, allowing for scheduling and realistic progression of time in the simulation.\n\n  - **Interactions:**\n    - Activity Trajectories: Simulate the movement of residents through urban environments by reconstructing their daily trajectories using the location-time pairs.\n    - Social Dynamics: Analyze patterns of location visits to simulate potential interactions between residents, especially at common locations visited by multiple individuals.\n    - Temporal Patterns: Utilize the time data to simulate peak times at locations, resident routines, and time-dependent interactions.\n    - Scenario Planning: Use the historical data to inform potential future scenarios, such as changes in urban infrastructure or resident behavior patterns. \n\nOverall, the data provides a rich source for simulating daily life trajectories of urban residents, capturing both the temporal and spatial dynamics essential for a realistic social simulation."

          "description": "I am now tasked with designing a social simulator. The simulator's goal is to simulate the daily activity trajectories of urban residents. Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

The data is organized as a dictionary, where each entry consists of a key-value pair.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n  In this JSON file, the keys represent specific locations found within an urban environment. These are identifiable places that individuals might visit during their daily activities, such as \"Train Station,\" \"Police Station,\" \"Shrine,\" \"City,\" and \"Convenience Store.\"\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n  The values corresponding to each key represent the category of the location. These categories provide context about the nature or primary function of each location. For instance, \"Train Station\" falls under the category \"Travel & Transport,\" indicating its role in facilitating movement and commuting. There are no nested elements in this data structure; each location is directly associated with a single category.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n  In the context of designing a social simulator, this data can be used to define the types of locations individuals might visit as part of their daily activity trajectories. Each location type can be associated with specific activities or interactions, influencing the behavior and decisions of the simulated urban residents. For example:\n  - **Travel & Transport:** Locations like \"Train Station\" may serve as nodes for transitioning between different areas of the city.\n  - **Professional & Other Places:** Locations such as \"Police Station\" and \"Shrine\" may be associated with work-related visits or cultural activities.\n  - **Outdoors & Recreation:** \"City\" can be a general area for various outdoor activities or leisure.\n  - **Shop & Service:** \"Convenience Store\" might represent quick stops for purchasing goods.\n\n  By categorizing locations, the simulator can generate realistic and varied daily trajectories, capturing the diversity of urban life and the interactions between residents and their environment.",

          "description": "I am now tasked with designing a social simulator. The simulator's goal is to simulate the daily activity trajectories of urban residents. Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

          "description": "I am now tasked with designing a social simulator. The simulator's goal is to simulate the daily activity trajectories of urban residents. Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

          "description": "I am now tasked with designing a social simulator. The simulator's goal is to simulate the daily activity trajectories of urban residents. Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

There are no nested elements in this data structure; each location is directly associated with a single category.\n\n- **How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n  In the context of designing a social simulator, this data can be used to define the types of locations individuals might visit as part of their daily activity trajectories. Each location type can be associated with specific activities or interactions, influencing the behavior and decisions of the simulated urban residents. For example:\n  - **Travel & Transport:** Locations like \"Train Station\" may serve as nodes for transitioning between different areas of the city.\n  - **Professional & Other Places:** Locations such as \"Police Station\" and \"Shrine\" may be associated with work-related visits or cultural activities.\n  - **Outdoors & Recreation:** \"City\" can be a general area for various outdoor activities or leisure.\n  - **Shop & Service:** \"Convenience Store\" might represent quick stops for purchasing goods.\n\n  By categorizing locations, the simulator can generate realistic and varied daily trajectories, capturing the diversity of urban life and the interactions between residents and their environment.",

You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",

          "description": "I am now tasked with designing a social simulator. The simulator's goal is to simulate the daily activity trajectories of urban residents. Each trajectory consists of an ordered sequence of location-time pairs: {(l\u2080, t\u2080), (l\u2081, t\u2081), ..., (l\u2099, t\u2099)}, representing the locations visited by an individual at specific times.",
          "simulation_focus": "Our agent-based framework is designed to generate daily mobility trajectories for individual urban residents. The core assumption is that a person\u2019s daily activities are driven by two primary factors \u2014 habitual behavioral patterns (Pattern) and instantaneous motivations (Motivation) \u2014 and one secondary factor, the individual's Persona.\n We first extract a set of representative behavioral patterns (Pattern) from the resident\u2019s historical trajectory data by prompting a large language model (LLM). A Pattern refers to a natural language description of a resident\u2019s routine mobility behaviors, generated based on behavioral statistics from historical data. These patterns capture how an individual tends to behave under certain temporal and spatial regularities.\n A typical pattern example might be: \u201cDuring weekdays, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You usually begin your daily trip at 09:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00. You typically visit Platform#479 at the beginning of the day and go to Convenience Store#7665 before returning home. During weekends, you usually travel over 40 kilometers a day. You begin your daily trip at 10:20:00 and end it at 18:20:00, often visiting Bakery#678 in the morning and Sports Club#9 in the evening. You frequently visit Sports Club#9 at 17:00:00, Platform#1330 at 09:00:00, Convenience Store#7665 at 08:00:00, Library#102 at 09:30:00, and Platform#479 at 09:00:00.\u201d\n These candidate patterns are generated during Phase 1: Pattern Recognition in the LLMob system and serve to capture each individual\u2019s typical daily routines in the urban context.\n Next, we also analyze the resident\u2019s historical trajectories, frequently visited locations, and travel routines to infer the individual's Persona \u2014 such as office worker, student, or night shift worker \u2014 using LLM prompting. This adds a semantic layer that further informs the agent\u2019s behavior.\n Once the Pattern and Persona are identified for a resident, we proceed to generate the resident\u2019s Motivation for a specific date. This daily motivation is inferred from the individual's recent behaviors and summarized through LLM prompting (e.g., to maintain fitness, go grocery shopping, or attend a family event). We then perform Motivation-Driven Activity Generation, where the LLM takes in the previously extracted Pattern, Persona, and the current-day Motivation to generate a logical daily trajectory. The output is in JSON format, including: The time of arrival at each location; The reason or motivation for visiting each location.\n",
