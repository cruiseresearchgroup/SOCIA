Higher values indicate greater perceived risk.\n- **initial_mask_wearing**: A boolean value indicating whether the agent initially wears a mask (true) or not (false).\n- **family_connections**: The number of direct family connections the agent has.\n- **work_school_connections**: The count of connections the agent has through work or school environments.\n- **community_connections**: The number of broader community connections.\n- **total_connections**: The sum of all types of connections (family, work/school, community), indicating the agent's overall social network size.\n\n#### Relationships or Nested Elements\n- The data is flat, with no explicit nesting. Each agent is represented independently with attributes that describe both individual characteristics and social network size.\n- Connections are categorized into family, work/school, and community, which collectively contribute to the agent's total connections, influencing potential for behavior spread.\n\n#### How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions\n- **Agents**: Each row corresponds to an agent in the simulation, characterized by demographics, occupation, and risk perception, which influence their behavior regarding mask-wearing.\n- **Social Network**: Connection counts inform the simulation of the network structure, affecting how mask-wearing behavior could propagate through different types of connections.\n- **Behavioral Dynamics**: Initial mask-wearing status and risk perception are key factors in determining how an agent might influence or be influenced by others in adopting mask-wearing behavior.\n- **Interactions**: The structure of connections (family, work/school, community) suggests pathways through which behavior can spread, emphasizing the role of social influence and risk perception in the dynamics of mask-wearing adoption.",
          "### Semantic Metadata Summary\n\n**Overall Data Structure and Type:**\n- The file is a JSON object containing key-value pairs, where each key is a string representing an individual in the social network, and the value is a nested JSON object. This structure is conducive to modeling relationships and interactions in a social network.\n\n**Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n- The outermost keys (e.g., \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", etc.) represent unique identifiers for individuals within the social network.\n- Each individual has associated lists categorized under three keys: \"family\", \"work_school\", and \"community\". These lists contain integer values representing the IDs of other individuals connected to them in different social contexts.\n- The \"all\" key consolidates all connections (family, work/school, and community) into a single list for each individual.\n\n**Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n- The nested JSON object for each individual categorizes their social connections into three distinct contexts:\n  - **Family:** Represents familial ties, indicating close personal relationships.\n  - **Work/School:** Represents professional or educational associations, crucial for modeling environments where mask-wearing behavior might be influenced by organizational policies.\n  - **Community:** Represents broader social interactions, such as neighborhood or community group connections, influencing social norms and behaviors.\n- These connections form a multi-layered network that can model how behaviors, such as mask-wearing, spread through different social contexts.\n\n**How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n- Each individual is an agent in the simulation, with their behavior potentially influenced by their network connections.\n- The simulation should account for the propagation of mask-wearing behavior through these connections, considering different influence strengths from family, work/school, and community contexts.\n- Interactions between agents can be modeled based on the presence of shared connections in these categories, allowing for the simulation of complex social dynamics and the spread of behaviors across the network.",
          "The `train_data.csv` file is a structured dataset in CSV format that records daily observations of individual agents' mask-wearing behavior and their reception of information regarding masks. Each entry represents a snapshot of a specific agent's state on a given day. Below is a semantic metadata summary of the file:\n\n- **Overall Data Structure and Type**: The dataset is structured as a series of records, each representing an observation of an agent on a particular day. The data type is CSV, with each row indicating the state of an agent for a given day.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns**:\n  - `day`: An integer representing the day of observation, indicating the temporal sequence of events.\n  - `agent_id`: A unique identifier for each agent, allowing the tracking of individual behavior over time.\n  - `wearing_mask`: A boolean value indicating whether the agent is wearing a mask (`true`) or not (`false`) on that day.\n  - `received_info`: A boolean value denoting whether the agent has received information about mask-wearing (`true`) or not (`false`).\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements**: Each row's data points are related by the `agent_id`, allowing tracking of longitudinal changes in behavior and information reception for each agent. There is no explicit nesting, but the dataset implicitly tracks sequences of behavior over time for each agent.\n\n- **Informing Simulation Entities or Interactions**: \n  - **Entities**: The `agent_id` represents individual agents in the simulation, each having states related to mask-wearing and information reception.\n  - **Interactions**: The data can be used to simulate social interactions or information spread influencing mask-wearing behavior. The `received_info` field may influence future states of `wearing_mask`, simulating how information dissemination impacts behavior.\n  - **Temporal Dynamics**: The `day` field helps simulate the temporal evolution of behaviors and how quickly information spreads through the network over time.\n\nThe dataset can be utilized to model and simulate the spread of mask-wearing behavior across a social network by capturing agents\u2019 responses to received information and their subsequent behavioral changes."

Higher values indicate greater perceived risk.\n- **initial_mask_wearing**: A boolean value indicating whether the agent initially wears a mask (true) or not (false).\n- **family_connections**: The number of direct family connections the agent has.\n- **work_school_connections**: The count of connections the agent has through work or school environments.\n- **community_connections**: The number of broader community connections.\n- **total_connections**: The sum of all types of connections (family, work/school, community), indicating the agent's overall social network size.\n\n#### Relationships or Nested Elements\n- The data is flat, with no explicit nesting. Each agent is represented independently with attributes that describe both individual characteristics and social network size.\n- Connections are categorized into family, work/school, and community, which collectively contribute to the agent's total connections, influencing potential for behavior spread.\n\n#### How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions\n- **Agents**: Each row corresponds to an agent in the simulation, characterized by demographics, occupation, and risk perception, which influence their behavior regarding mask-wearing.\n- **Social Network**: Connection counts inform the simulation of the network structure, affecting how mask-wearing behavior could propagate through different types of connections.\n- **Behavioral Dynamics**: Initial mask-wearing status and risk perception are key factors in determining how an agent might influence or be influenced by others in adopting mask-wearing behavior.\n- **Interactions**: The structure of connections (family, work/school, community) suggests pathways through which behavior can spread, emphasizing the role of social influence and risk perception in the dynamics of mask-wearing adoption.",
            "### Semantic Metadata Summary\n\n**Overall Data Structure and Type:**\n- The file is a JSON object containing key-value pairs, where each key is a string representing an individual in the social network, and the value is a nested JSON object. This structure is conducive to modeling relationships and interactions in a social network.\n\n**Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n- The outermost keys (e.g., \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", etc.) represent unique identifiers for individuals within the social network.\n- Each individual has associated lists categorized under three keys: \"family\", \"work_school\", and \"community\". These lists contain integer values representing the IDs of other individuals connected to them in different social contexts.\n- The \"all\" key consolidates all connections (family, work/school, and community) into a single list for each individual.\n\n**Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n- The nested JSON object for each individual categorizes their social connections into three distinct contexts:\n  - **Family:** Represents familial ties, indicating close personal relationships.\n  - **Work/School:** Represents professional or educational associations, crucial for modeling environments where mask-wearing behavior might be influenced by organizational policies.\n  - **Community:** Represents broader social interactions, such as neighborhood or community group connections, influencing social norms and behaviors.\n- These connections form a multi-layered network that can model how behaviors, such as mask-wearing, spread through different social contexts.\n\n**How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n- Each individual is an agent in the simulation, with their behavior potentially influenced by their network connections.\n- The simulation should account for the propagation of mask-wearing behavior through these connections, considering different influence strengths from family, work/school, and community contexts.\n- Interactions between agents can be modeled based on the presence of shared connections in these categories, allowing for the simulation of complex social dynamics and the spread of behaviors across the network.",
            "The `train_data.csv` file is a structured dataset in CSV format that records daily observations of individual agents' mask-wearing behavior and their reception of information regarding masks. Each entry represents a snapshot of a specific agent's state on a given day. Below is a semantic metadata summary of the file:\n\n- **Overall Data Structure and Type**: The dataset is structured as a series of records, each representing an observation of an agent on a particular day. The data type is CSV, with each row indicating the state of an agent for a given day.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns**:\n  - `day`: An integer representing the day of observation, indicating the temporal sequence of events.\n  - `agent_id`: A unique identifier for each agent, allowing the tracking of individual behavior over time.\n  - `wearing_mask`: A boolean value indicating whether the agent is wearing a mask (`true`) or not (`false`) on that day.\n  - `received_info`: A boolean value denoting whether the agent has received information about mask-wearing (`true`) or not (`false`).\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements**: Each row's data points are related by the `agent_id`, allowing tracking of longitudinal changes in behavior and information reception for each agent. There is no explicit nesting, but the dataset implicitly tracks sequences of behavior over time for each agent.\n\n- **Informing Simulation Entities or Interactions**: \n  - **Entities**: The `agent_id` represents individual agents in the simulation, each having states related to mask-wearing and information reception.\n  - **Interactions**: The data can be used to simulate social interactions or information spread influencing mask-wearing behavior. The `received_info` field may influence future states of `wearing_mask`, simulating how information dissemination impacts behavior.\n  - **Temporal Dynamics**: The `day` field helps simulate the temporal evolution of behaviors and how quickly information spreads through the network over time.\n\nThe dataset can be utilized to model and simulate the spread of mask-wearing behavior across a social network by capturing agents\u2019 responses to received information and their subsequent behavioral changes."

Higher values indicate greater perceived risk.\n- **initial_mask_wearing**: A boolean value indicating whether the agent initially wears a mask (true) or not (false).\n- **family_connections**: The number of direct family connections the agent has.\n- **work_school_connections**: The count of connections the agent has through work or school environments.\n- **community_connections**: The number of broader community connections.\n- **total_connections**: The sum of all types of connections (family, work/school, community), indicating the agent's overall social network size.\n\n#### Relationships or Nested Elements\n- The data is flat, with no explicit nesting. Each agent is represented independently with attributes that describe both individual characteristics and social network size.\n- Connections are categorized into family, work/school, and community, which collectively contribute to the agent's total connections, influencing potential for behavior spread.\n\n#### How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions\n- **Agents**: Each row corresponds to an agent in the simulation, characterized by demographics, occupation, and risk perception, which influence their behavior regarding mask-wearing.\n- **Social Network**: Connection counts inform the simulation of the network structure, affecting how mask-wearing behavior could propagate through different types of connections.\n- **Behavioral Dynamics**: Initial mask-wearing status and risk perception are key factors in determining how an agent might influence or be influenced by others in adopting mask-wearing behavior.\n- **Interactions**: The structure of connections (family, work/school, community) suggests pathways through which behavior can spread, emphasizing the role of social influence and risk perception in the dynamics of mask-wearing adoption.",
            "### Semantic Metadata Summary\n\n**Overall Data Structure and Type:**\n- The file is a JSON object containing key-value pairs, where each key is a string representing an individual in the social network, and the value is a nested JSON object. This structure is conducive to modeling relationships and interactions in a social network.\n\n**Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n- The outermost keys (e.g., \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", etc.) represent unique identifiers for individuals within the social network.\n- Each individual has associated lists categorized under three keys: \"family\", \"work_school\", and \"community\". These lists contain integer values representing the IDs of other individuals connected to them in different social contexts.\n- The \"all\" key consolidates all connections (family, work/school, and community) into a single list for each individual.\n\n**Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n- The nested JSON object for each individual categorizes their social connections into three distinct contexts:\n  - **Family:** Represents familial ties, indicating close personal relationships.\n  - **Work/School:** Represents professional or educational associations, crucial for modeling environments where mask-wearing behavior might be influenced by organizational policies.\n  - **Community:** Represents broader social interactions, such as neighborhood or community group connections, influencing social norms and behaviors.\n- These connections form a multi-layered network that can model how behaviors, such as mask-wearing, spread through different social contexts.\n\n**How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n- Each individual is an agent in the simulation, with their behavior potentially influenced by their network connections.\n- The simulation should account for the propagation of mask-wearing behavior through these connections, considering different influence strengths from family, work/school, and community contexts.\n- Interactions between agents can be modeled based on the presence of shared connections in these categories, allowing for the simulation of complex social dynamics and the spread of behaviors across the network.",
            "The `train_data.csv` file is a structured dataset in CSV format that records daily observations of individual agents' mask-wearing behavior and their reception of information regarding masks. Each entry represents a snapshot of a specific agent's state on a given day. Below is a semantic metadata summary of the file:\n\n- **Overall Data Structure and Type**: The dataset is structured as a series of records, each representing an observation of an agent on a particular day. The data type is CSV, with each row indicating the state of an agent for a given day.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns**:\n  - `day`: An integer representing the day of observation, indicating the temporal sequence of events.\n  - `agent_id`: A unique identifier for each agent, allowing the tracking of individual behavior over time.\n  - `wearing_mask`: A boolean value indicating whether the agent is wearing a mask (`true`) or not (`false`) on that day.\n  - `received_info`: A boolean value denoting whether the agent has received information about mask-wearing (`true`) or not (`false`).\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements**: Each row's data points are related by the `agent_id`, allowing tracking of longitudinal changes in behavior and information reception for each agent. There is no explicit nesting, but the dataset implicitly tracks sequences of behavior over time for each agent.\n\n- **Informing Simulation Entities or Interactions**: \n  - **Entities**: The `agent_id` represents individual agents in the simulation, each having states related to mask-wearing and information reception.\n  - **Interactions**: The data can be used to simulate social interactions or information spread influencing mask-wearing behavior. The `received_info` field may influence future states of `wearing_mask`, simulating how information dissemination impacts behavior.\n  - **Temporal Dynamics**: The `day` field helps simulate the temporal evolution of behaviors and how quickly information spreads through the network over time.\n\nThe dataset can be utilized to model and simulate the spread of mask-wearing behavior across a social network by capturing agents\u2019 responses to received information and their subsequent behavioral changes."

Higher values indicate greater perceived risk.\n- **initial_mask_wearing**: A boolean value indicating whether the agent initially wears a mask (true) or not (false).\n- **family_connections**: The number of direct family connections the agent has.\n- **work_school_connections**: The count of connections the agent has through work or school environments.\n- **community_connections**: The number of broader community connections.\n- **total_connections**: The sum of all types of connections (family, work/school, community), indicating the agent's overall social network size.\n\n#### Relationships or Nested Elements\n- The data is flat, with no explicit nesting. Each agent is represented independently with attributes that describe both individual characteristics and social network size.\n- Connections are categorized into family, work/school, and community, which collectively contribute to the agent's total connections, influencing potential for behavior spread.\n\n#### How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions\n- **Agents**: Each row corresponds to an agent in the simulation, characterized by demographics, occupation, and risk perception, which influence their behavior regarding mask-wearing.\n- **Social Network**: Connection counts inform the simulation of the network structure, affecting how mask-wearing behavior could propagate through different types of connections.\n- **Behavioral Dynamics**: Initial mask-wearing status and risk perception are key factors in determining how an agent might influence or be influenced by others in adopting mask-wearing behavior.\n- **Interactions**: The structure of connections (family, work/school, community) suggests pathways through which behavior can spread, emphasizing the role of social influence and risk perception in the dynamics of mask-wearing adoption.",
            "### Semantic Metadata Summary\n\n**Overall Data Structure and Type:**\n- The file is a JSON object containing key-value pairs, where each key is a string representing an individual in the social network, and the value is a nested JSON object. This structure is conducive to modeling relationships and interactions in a social network.\n\n**Meaning of Keys or Columns:**\n- The outermost keys (e.g., \"0\", \"1\", \"2\", etc.) represent unique identifiers for individuals within the social network.\n- Each individual has associated lists categorized under three keys: \"family\", \"work_school\", and \"community\". These lists contain integer values representing the IDs of other individuals connected to them in different social contexts.\n- The \"all\" key consolidates all connections (family, work/school, and community) into a single list for each individual.\n\n**Relationships or Nested Elements:**\n- The nested JSON object for each individual categorizes their social connections into three distinct contexts:\n  - **Family:** Represents familial ties, indicating close personal relationships.\n  - **Work/School:** Represents professional or educational associations, crucial for modeling environments where mask-wearing behavior might be influenced by organizational policies.\n  - **Community:** Represents broader social interactions, such as neighborhood or community group connections, influencing social norms and behaviors.\n- These connections form a multi-layered network that can model how behaviors, such as mask-wearing, spread through different social contexts.\n\n**How This Data Should Inform Simulation Entities or Interactions:**\n- Each individual is an agent in the simulation, with their behavior potentially influenced by their network connections.\n- The simulation should account for the propagation of mask-wearing behavior through these connections, considering different influence strengths from family, work/school, and community contexts.\n- Interactions between agents can be modeled based on the presence of shared connections in these categories, allowing for the simulation of complex social dynamics and the spread of behaviors across the network.",
            "The `train_data.csv` file is a structured dataset in CSV format that records daily observations of individual agents' mask-wearing behavior and their reception of information regarding masks. Each entry represents a snapshot of a specific agent's state on a given day. Below is a semantic metadata summary of the file:\n\n- **Overall Data Structure and Type**: The dataset is structured as a series of records, each representing an observation of an agent on a particular day. The data type is CSV, with each row indicating the state of an agent for a given day.\n\n- **Meaning of Keys or Columns**:\n  - `day`: An integer representing the day of observation, indicating the temporal sequence of events.\n  - `agent_id`: A unique identifier for each agent, allowing the tracking of individual behavior over time.\n  - `wearing_mask`: A boolean value indicating whether the agent is wearing a mask (`true`) or not (`false`) on that day.\n  - `received_info`: A boolean value denoting whether the agent has received information about mask-wearing (`true`) or not (`false`).\n\n- **Relationships or Nested Elements**: Each row's data points are related by the `agent_id`, allowing tracking of longitudinal changes in behavior and information reception for each agent. There is no explicit nesting, but the dataset implicitly tracks sequences of behavior over time for each agent.\n\n- **Informing Simulation Entities or Interactions**: \n  - **Entities**: The `agent_id` represents individual agents in the simulation, each having states related to mask-wearing and information reception.\n  - **Interactions**: The data can be used to simulate social interactions or information spread influencing mask-wearing behavior. The `received_info` field may influence future states of `wearing_mask`, simulating how information dissemination impacts behavior.\n  - **Temporal Dynamics**: The `day` field helps simulate the temporal evolution of behaviors and how quickly information spreads through the network over time.\n\nThe dataset can be utilized to model and simulate the spread of mask-wearing behavior across a social network by capturing agents\u2019 responses to received information and their subsequent behavioral changes."
