  "summary": "The verification process identified critical implementation issues preventing the simulation from properly tracking and reporting the cumulative number of infections over time. While the core SIR state transition logic appears sound, the data structure used for the 'total_infections' metric is incorrect for time-series analysis, rendering plotting and CSV output for this key metric dysfunctional. Simulation execution and evaluation were not possible in the current state.",
  "critical_issues": [
    {
      "issue": "The cumulative number of individuals ever infected ('total_infections') is stored as a single value that is updated, rather than a time series list that is appended to at each step.",
      "impact": "This prevents the simulation from generating a plot or CSV output showing the growth of cumulative infections over time, which is a fundamental metric for understanding epidemic progression. It makes evaluation of the simulation's results against expectations or real-world data impossible for this metric.",
      "solution": "Modify the simulation class to initialize a list to store cumulative infections and append the current count to this list at the end of each time step."

      "current_gap": "The current simple SIR model lacks features present in real-world scenarios that significantly influence epidemic dynamics, such as age structure, spatial distribution, heterogeneous contact rates, asymptomatic transmission, varying disease severity, and interventions (e.g., social distancing, vaccination). Without these, the simulation results will likely deviate significantly from observed data.",
      "suggestion": "Once the basic model runs correctly, consider introducing features like a contact network to represent realistic interactions, adding an 'Asymptomatic' state, or allowing for parameter heterogeneity among agents to better align the simulation's dynamics with the complexities of real-world epidemics. (Note: This goes beyond the scope of a 'simple' model but is necessary for better data alignment)."

    "1. Fix the critical implementation issue regarding the storage of the cumulative infections metric as a time series list.",

    "4. Execute the simulation.",
    "5. Evaluate the simulation results against the 'population_conservation' and 'plausible_epidemic_curve' validation criteria."

  "additional_comments": "The verification process successfully identified a critical blocking issue before execution, validating the usefulness of this stage. The identified issues are straightforward implementation fixes. Addressing these will enable successful execution and subsequent evaluation of the simulation's output against the defined validation criteria."
