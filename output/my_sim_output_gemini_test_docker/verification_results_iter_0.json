  "summary": "The code implements the core SIR agent-based simulation logic correctly, including state transitions and parameter handling. Parameter validation and population conservation checks are present. However, there is a significant issue with how the 'total_infections' cumulative metric is stored and reported over time, affecting visualization and data saving.",
  "issues": [
    {
      "type": "implementation",
      "severity": "major",
      "description": "The 'total_infections' metric, representing the cumulative number of individuals ever infected, is calculated correctly using the `_ever_infected_ids` set. However, it is stored only as a single value (`self.metrics[\"total_infections\"]`) which is updated at each step, rather than being stored as a time series list. This prevents accurate plotting of cumulative infections over time and causes the default CSV saving path to omit this crucial metric.",
      "location": "Simulation class: __init__, _time_step, _calculate_metrics. Functions: plot_results, save_results_to_csv.",
      "solution": "Modify the `Simulation` class `__init__` to initialize a list for cumulative infections (e.g., `self.metrics[\"cumulative_infected_ever\"] = []`). Update the `_calculate_metrics` method to append `len(self._ever_infected_ids)` to this list at each time step. Update the `plot_results` and `save_results_to_csv` functions to use this new list for plotting and saving the cumulative infected count over time."
    },
    {
      "type": "implementation",
      "severity": "minor",
      "description": "The `plot_results` function attempts to plot the 'Total Infected (Cumulative)' by repeating the final cumulative value for all time steps (`[metrics[\"total_infections\"]] * len(metrics[\"time_step\"])`). This results in a misleading flat line on the plot instead of showing the growth of cumulative infections over time.",
      "location": "plot_results function",
      "solution": "This issue will be resolved by implementing the solution for the major issue above. Once cumulative infections are stored as a time series list, plot that list against the time steps."
    },
    {
      "type": "implementation",
      "severity": "minor",
      "description": "The `save_results_to_csv` function's primary logic path checks for a 'cumulative_infected_ever' key which is not present in the `metrics` dictionary as currently structured by the `Simulation` class. This causes the function to fall back to saving only S, I, and R counts, omitting the 'total_infections' metric from the output CSV.",
      "location": "save_results_to_csv function",
      "solution": "This issue will be resolved by implementing the solution for the major issue above. Once cumulative infections are stored as a time series list under a key like 'cumulative_infected_ever', the CSV function will correctly include it."

    {
      "type": "logic",
      "severity": "minor",
      "description": "The well-mixed interaction model, where every susceptible agent potentially contacts every infected agent in a single time step, is O(S*I). While acceptable for the specified population size (1000 agents), this approach becomes computationally expensive for larger populations and doesn't reflect more realistic contact patterns. The prompt describes 'contact_and_transmission' but doesn't strictly define the contact model, so O(SI) is a valid interpretation for 'simple' but worth noting.",
      "location": "Simulation class: _time_step method (Infection Process loop)",
      "solution": "For larger scale simulations, consider implementing a more efficient or realistic contact model, such as random pair sampling (O(N)) or a network-based approach (O(Edges)). For the current scope (1000 agents), this is not a critical performance bottleneck but is a limitation for scaling."
