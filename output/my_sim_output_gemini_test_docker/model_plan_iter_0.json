State Update: After checking all potential infections and recoveries for the step, iterate through all agents. If an agent's ID is in 'agents_to_infect_ids' AND their current state is 'Susceptible', change their state to 'Infected'. If an agent's ID is in 'agents_to_recover_ids' AND their current state is 'Infected', change their state to 'Recovered'. 6.
