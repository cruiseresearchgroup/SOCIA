  "summary": "The simulation execution failed due to a runtime error, preventing the generation of simulation metrics and making the provided evaluation results potentially based on a previous or hypothetical run. While verification indicates the code structure is sound and implements basic features, the critical execution failure must be addressed immediately. Model improvements and data alignment suggestions from the evaluation provide valuable direction once the simulation can run reliably.",
  "critical_issues": [
    {
      "issue": "Simulation execution failed due to a runtime error (`name '__file__' is not defined`).",
      "impact": "Prevents the simulation from running, generating results, or being evaluated based on the current code. This is the most significant blocker.",
      "solution": "Identify the root cause of the `__file__` error. This typically occurs when code expecting to be run as a script is executed in a different context (e.g., within an interpreter or an environment where `__file__` is not automatically defined). Ensure the script is being run correctly, or refactor the relevant code to not rely on `__file__` in that context (e.g., use `os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__file__))` carefully, or pass necessary paths as arguments)."

      "aspect": "Spatial Distribution and Interaction",

      "suggested_approach": "Implement a spatial component. Agents could exist on a grid or in a graph, and interactions could be proximity-based. This aligns with the evaluation recommendation to 'Improve the spatial distribution mechanism'.",

Instead of just checking names or performing basic final-state checks, implement more rigorous validation (e.g., check population conservation at *each* time step, use more robust methods for verifying epidemic curve shape if needed, verify state transitions by tracking individual agent state changes).",

Note: The task spec says 1000, evaluation says 100 vs 120. Clarify the target population size.",
      "note": "There is a discrepancy between the task specification's population size (1000) and the evaluation's entity count (100 vs 120). This needs clarification. Assuming the evaluation refers to a specific scenario run, align the simulation parameter to that scenario's target population."

Tune parameters (infection_probability, recovery_probability, interactions_per_person) to better match observed epidemic curves.",
