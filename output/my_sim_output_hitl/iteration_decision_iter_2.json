There are critical issues, such as the File I/O error and non-random initial infection assignment, that need to be addressed. Additionally, there is potential for significant improvement, especially in model accuracy, by refining spatial distribution and agent behaviors. Since we are approaching the maximum number of iterations, it is crucial to make these adjustments in the next iteration.",
