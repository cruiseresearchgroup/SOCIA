  "summary": "The Epidemic Simulation Model is generally well-structured, but there are several areas that need improvements to enhance performance, realism, and code quality. The most critical issues include performance inefficiencies, error handling, and discrepancies between simulation results and real-world data. Addressing these issues will lead to a more accurate and robust simulation.",
