      "type": "performance",
      "severity": "medium",
      "description": "The infection transmission logic uses nested loops for interactions, which could be inefficient with larger populations.",

      "solution": "Consider using spatial data structures like grids or quad-trees to reduce the number of interactions checked."

      "solution": "Add checks or try-except blocks to handle potential exceptions, ensuring robustness."
