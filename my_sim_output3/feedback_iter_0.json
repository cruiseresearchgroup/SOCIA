  "summary": "The Simple Epidemic Simulation Model requires critical improvements in its implementation to function correctly and align with real-world data. Key issues include missing class definitions, incomplete logic for virus transmission, and lack of error handling. Addressing these will enhance the model's accuracy and robustness.",

    {
      "issue": "Missing implementations for 'agent.py' and 'environment.py'.",

      "issue": "Lack of explicit virus transmission logic.",
