      "This Spears schedule 40 PVC tee fitting has barbed male inserts on each end, and is suitable for connecting and branching flexible polyethylene tubes. The barbed ends allow a quick connection to flexible tubing. The fitting is T-shaped and has three openings to connect and branch three tubes, two on the main run and one branch at a 90-degree angle from the middle of the tee. Dimensions for tees are represented as A x B x C. “A” and “B” indicate the main run on the fitting, and “C” indicates the branch. The fitting is made of gray PVC (polyvinyl chloride) for chemical and corrosion resistance, high strength, and less weight than fittings made from metal. It is compatible with SIDR-PR (standard inside dimension ratios, pressure rated) flexible polyethylene tubing according to ASTM International standard D2239, or standard D2104 schedule 40 polyethylene tubing. The fitting has a maximum operating temperature of 140 degrees F, meets ASTM International D1784 and D2609 standards for quality assurance, and is certified by National Sanitation Foundation International (NSF) for potable water service. This PVC tee fitting is suitable for connecting flexible polyethylene tubing for a range of liquid transfer applications.",
      "Tube fittings are components used for connecting, branching, terminating, and changing the direction of tubing in pneumatic and hydraulic systems. They are made of brass, stainless steel, PBT (polybutylene terephthalate), and other materials that resist corrosion and wear. Tube fittings have various types of connections, including threaded, welded, barbed, and push-to-connect (also called one-touch). Push-to-connect connections do not require tools or sealants. Tube fittings are used in various applications, including machine tools, airplane and truck controls, and automated production lines, among others.",
      "Spears Manufacturing produces thermoplastic fittings and valves for fluid, drain, waste, and vent systems. The company, founded in 1969 and headquartered in Sylmar, CA, meets International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard 9001."

      "A unique thread design and quality controlled manufacture spell the zip-in difference. Zip-in's sophisticated heat treat process allows the screw to taper to a fine, sharp point without sacrificing critical point strength. A single starting thread is formed down to the very tip of the point and is the source of zip-in's penetrating power. A second thread above the point engages after initial penetration and drills in the screw double fast. Zip-in screws are faster driving, with a greater capacity for fastening heavier gauges of sheet metal than any other self-piercing type."

      "[30 Days Hands-Free Cleaning] You can enjoy up to 30 days of automatic, hands-free cleaning thanks to the 19,000 rpm motor, which empties dirt and dust into a hygienically sealed 2.5-liter dust bag, never returning to the floor. All you have to do every 30 days is replace the bag. It's very easy and you never need to touch a dirty bin again.",
      "[Intelligent Mop Lifting] A8+ robot vacuum cleaner knows when and where to automatically lift the back plate that holds the mop. With a lift height of 10mm, the mop lifts off the ground and steers away from the carpets to prevent them from getting wet. A8+ robot vacuum lifts the mop pad in the docking station to air dry to help prevent odor.",
      "[LiDAR Navigation] Combining next-generation LiDAR scanning with line laser sensor processing, the A8+ robot vacuum and mop combo can calculate its physical location inside your home even in the dark. This means no more bumps or random cleaning paths. The A8+ self emptying robot vacuum cleaner is always on the right track for getting the most time-efficient and energy-saving path.",
      "[Customized Cleaning with Multiple Maps] The A8+ Vacuum Robot with Mapping can store maps for up to 3 floor maps, which can be customized according to your preferences. With multiple maps, you don't have to go through the mapping process every time you change floors. The power now lies in your hands.",
      "[180 Minutes Runtime] With a 5200mAh battery, the A8+ robotic vacuum can keep cleaning for 180 minutes when in full charge. It is suitable for big house cleaning. When the job is done, the vacuum returns to the dock, lifts the mop to dry, and automatically recharges."

      "Passive Direct Box with Stereo Input Summed Mono Output"
    ],
    "description": [
      "If you run live sound, then here's a handy tool you'll want to keep in your bag of tricks. The Whirlwind podDI is a passive direct box that's purpose built for patching iPods, CD players, Laptops, and any other consumer music device into your mixing console. Like all of Whirlwind's direct boxes, the podDI is built tough enough to take the rigors of the stage and has handy controls that are easy to use. A stereo 1/8\" jack serves as the podDI's main input, though it has a stereo pair of RCA input jacks as well. What's even better is that the podDI's two sets of inputs run in parallel, so you can use one as an input and the other as a loop-though output to a personal monitor on stage - a real life saver! Also, there's a pair of attenuators for the left and right input channels, so you can adjust the mix right on the podDI. A single summed XLR output with a switchable ground lift gives you the clear, noise-free sound you need."

Launchpad S is the evolution of Novation's best-selling Launchpad controller, with brighter buttons, significantly faster refresh rate and it supports multiple software.

There is also a range of effects that can be triggered using the buttons. Launchpad S integrates with FL Studio's performance mode, so you can trigger clips and get hands-on control of powerful new performance zone features.

You can control almost any music software using Novation's award-winning Automap control software-and Launchpad S is fully MIDI class-compliant so it drives any MIDI application. It also comes with a software version of Novation's analog mono-synth-the Bass Station. You can use this as a plug-in within Ableton, FL Studio or other DAWs.

      "What is delay?",
      "Delay is a synthetic echo that, in adjustable increments, repeats the notes you play on guitar. Each repeated tone becomes quieter than the previous one, until the repeats are no longer heard. This results in a thick, robust sound that can take on everything from the quick \"slap\" echo of classic rockabilly to the long, dreamy echoes found in psychedelic rock.",

Take advantage of its full 1.3-second memory or scale it back for a more abrupt echo. Just twist the dedicated Mode, Time, Feedback and Level controls to create the delay of your dreams. There is also a HOLD mode that allows you to loop a brief riff, then play over it. The blue LED tells you when it's on, and the first-class on/off switch maintains incredible signal integrity in bypass mode. You can power the DD400 with a 9 V battery or a DC power adapter.",

      "The Xotic EP Booster is a discrete FET preamp pedal with a low impedance output. The EP Booster was based around the classic preamp side of an Echoplex and produces a shimmering boost tone that adds some high end sparkle and definition. The Xotic EP Booster features up to 20db of gain on tap and two internal DIP switches to customize the boost. One is a Bass Boost and the other is a Bright switch. The default setting is Bright on/Bass Boost off. This provides extra sparkle for the darker sounding instruments and is great for that extra edge or shimmer. The Bass Boost adds just the right amount of low end for single coils to keep up. By turning off the Bright Switch you can get a full frequency boost that is transparent and gives you back what you put into it. The Xotic EP Booster is a versatile boost pedal with more options than it appears. For that classic tone you’ve been searching for, check out the Xotic EP Booster."

      "Product description: Learn 12 great swing standards recorded by Django Reinhardt, Stephane Grappelli, and the Quintette of the Hot Club of France. Play along with a great Gypsy Swing Rhythm Section and learn chords, comping, and melodies, then let the band back you up as you practice chords and soloing. You play all the leads while the band backs you up. Beginners can practice basic skills while more advanced players can hone their improvisation chops, each at their own individual learning pace. Includes standard notation, tablature, chord diagrams, lyrics, playing tips, and more. Each song is presented on the CD at slow and regular speed. First you'll hear the melody played on mandolin at a slow speed with just guitar backup, then it's repeated at regular speed with the band. Split track mixing on the recording allows the student to hear just the melody (while reading along in the book) or just the rhythm section, or both for maximum flexibility and specific study. Finally the band plays several choruses and you play all the leads. Songs may be repeated, at slow or regular speed, as many times as you wish in order to perfect phrases, melodies and solos in a band context. Includes special section on how to play rhythm back up chords and get that swing pulse on mandolin. Potential for improvement is unlimited. Guitar version also available. We'll jam all night long!"

      "About the Author",
      "Dix Bruce, a musician, composer, and writer from the San Francisco Bay Area, was born and raised in the Midwest. His interest in American folk music, jazz, and original composition are blended into a unique vocal and instrumental sound. His compositions are fresh and his energetic, exuberant stage personality, along with his driving rhythm and lead work, set the tone for a warm and exciting performance. He began playing guitar at age twelve. After college, he relocated to the Bay Area where his interest in hybrid acoustic string music led him to David Grisman's prototype quintet in the mid-1970's. Bruce eventually teamed up with the mandolinist and edited the magazine Mandolin World News from 1978 until 1984. In 1978 Bruce formed the band Back Up and Push to explore the emerging possibilities of swing and jazz on acoustic stringed instruments. The band toured the west coast throughout the 1980s and accompanied Bruce on his release Tuxedo Blues, which features many of his original instrumental and vocal compositions. Dix Bruce has done studio work on guitar, mandolin, and banjo and has recorded two albums with mandolin legend Frank Wakefield, six big band CDs with the Royal society Jazz Orchestra, and his own collection of American folk songs entitled My Folk Heart on which he plays guitar, mandolin, and autoharp as well as sings. In 1991 he contributed two original compositions to the soundtrack of Harrod Blank's acclaimed documentary Wild Wheels. he has released two CDs of traditional American songs with and originals with guitarist Jim Nunally. Dix arranged, composed, played mandolin, and recorded music for the CD-ROM computer game \"The Sims\" for the Maxis Corporation. His music is featured on a virtual radio station within the game. Mr. Bruce currently has over twenty publications in print with Mel Bay. He has also written for Acoustic Guitar Magazine, FRETS, Bluegrass Unlimited, and The Fretted Instrument Guild of America."

It eliminates both mechanical noise and breathiness to deliver clear and crystal sound to your teammates/audience. What is certain is that nothing technical can limit your performance, whether when gaming or recording.",
      "Plug and Play: Ideal for starter podcasters, gamers, or YouTubers. All you have to do is plug the cable into your mic, and slide the other one into your Mac or Windows computer. After that, Q9 will be recognized immediately with no additional driver or device required, applicable to mainstream software such as OBS/Discord/Teamspeak/Zoom. Note: Compatible with PS4/5, but not with Xbox!!!",
      "User-friendly Design: The external volume buttons allow you to instantly adjust the volume or turn off the mic when needed. Save the trouble of computer operations, and enjoy a smoother recording/game experience. In the working state, a short press adjusts the volume, and a long press turns off the microphone.",
      "Valuable Starter Kit: No need to invest the mic accessories. Besides the condenser microphone, the Q9 set has an adjustable boom arm, metal shock mount, desk mount clamp, pop filter, foam mic cover, 1.8M USB A to B cable, and manual.

    "description": [
      "Amazon.com",
      "Asheron's Call",
      "is an online-only role-playing game that immerses players in an original fantasy world, where they must choose to compete or cooperate with thousands of other players. Players can create characters that are truly unique with extensive combinations of visual appearance, attributes, and skill sets. A detailed and extensive system of allegiance facilitates a dimension of social game play never before experienced in a computer game. The online nature of this game provides the ability to create an evolving and dynamic adventure inside a persistent universe. The game will never be solved because there will always be more areas to explore and more quests to complete!",
      "NOTE:",
      "Gaming Zone membership is required to set your Asheron's Call account. A monthly service charge is applicable after your trial period ends. Zone Membership is subject to the terms of the Zone License agreement.",
      "Review",
      "At a glance, Turbine's massively multiplayer online RPG Asheron's Call may not seem very attractive; its uninspired presentation, esoteric setting, clumsy combat system, and cluttered interface do little to recommend it over its competitors. Yet despite these weaknesses, Asheron's Call has a number of even greater strengths, and it's these strengths that let it stand both on even footing with and apart from any of its contemporaries.",
      "As mentioned, Asheron's Call probably won't make a very good first impression on you, particularly if you're familiar with its competition, Origin's Ultima Online and Verant's EverQuest. Though Asheron's Call's characters' clean lines and motion-captured animation beat Ultima Online's diminutive, washed-out sprites handily, their uniformly simple, blocky models and equally simple textures can't compare with EverQuest's diverse pool of expertly textured high-fantasy inhabitants. As in Ultima Online, every single playable character in Asheron's Call is human, so you'll never be able to play as a hulking ogre or a lithe elf. You'll also never do battle with standard high-fantasy monsters; instead of fighting against dragons and ogres, you'll fight against giant insect Olthoi and catlike Drudges.",
      "Asheron's Call sounds about as unassuming as it looks. For the most part, sound is sparse in Asheron's Call; other than the odd ambient sound of a wandering creature, the gust of wind produced by a magic spell, or the shouts and grunts of combat, Asheron's Call is more or less completely silent. All of these sounds are effective if nothing else, though some monsters, like the mewling drudges, sound silly; others, like the chittering mites, sound downright annoying. This isn't to say that Asheron's Call actually sounds especially bad. What little sound there is, is usually loud, crisp, and clearly indicative of the event, creature, character, or combat exchange that caused it.",
      "And combat is one of the most important parts of Asheron's Call's gameplay. Unfortunately, it's nearly always marked by awkward pauses. Drawing your weapon, sheathing your weapon, or doing nearly anything else causes you to stop dead in your tracks - which can make pursuing fleeing monsters, doing battle with multiple enemies, or beating a hasty retreat of your own needlessly difficult. Fortunately, the monsters' artificial intelligence is lax enough to allow this; many monsters can be led to walls or other obstacles onto which they'll get stuck and can then easily be dispatched.",
      "But there's more to combat in Asheron's Call than just jarring pauses and gullible monsters. Melee combat is actually a fairly sophisticated affair: You can choose both the speed with which and the height at which you swing your weapon. As a result, combat is much more strategic than in other games of this sort, as it factors in an enemy's weak points and the amount of stamina your character expends while fighting. And the monsters themselves can be surprisingly persistent, in spite of their sometimes-flawed behavior routines. Monsters wielding ranged weapons will draw an unerring bead on you and fire away, while those not so equipped will pursue you across some distance before they give up. Yes, unlike the unrelenting monsters of EverQuest, Asheron's Call's monsters will eventually stop chasing you if you run far enough. Though it can be said that this eliminates some of the challenge of combat, it also makes solo play in Asheron's Call much more feasible than in other games, like EverQuest, whose insanely powerful and relentlessly vindictive high-level monsters more or less require you to group with other players after a certain point. Asheron's Call offers a more complete gaming experience in this regard, since it's actually possible to play productively with companions or alone, especially if you can't seem to find a group.",
      "This isn't to say that solo play is the best way to go; a good group is much more effective in slaying monsters, recovering treasure, and gaining experience points than a solo player is. To this end, Asheron's Call has two grouping systems: the fellowship and the allegiance. The fellowship is a standard adventuring party that lasts only as long as its members decide to stay together. However, the allegiance system is an innovative and completely unique means of character association. In it, characters swear fealty to other characters; these vassals provide an experience-point bonus to their lords, in whose best interests it is to help their vassals in turn, as lords receive the most bonuses from active and successful subjects. In addition, as a lord's vassal conscripts recruits of his own, that lord advances in rank and receives an even larger bonus from his subjects' activities. At worst, the allegiance system is a multilevel marketing scheme, whereby greedy, uncaring patrons enlist as many vassals as possible in order to gain large amounts of bonus experience. But at best, the allegiance system can provide a tightly knit companionship for players genuinely interested in helping others and developing an organized assembly. And should either of these social systems become confusing, unrewarding, or tiresome, you can leave them by toggling a simple on/off option buried deep within Asheron's Call's interface.",
      "Once you've generated a character, you can set out to see the world, fight monsters, and gain experience points. You can use these experience points to further develop your character by spending the points on attribute and skill increases. In contrast to other games, where character advancement is mostly vertical - that is, a character's abilities are governed almost entirely by his experience level - Asheron's Call lets characters advance both vertically and laterally. In other words, gaining experience points not only increases your character's inherent power in the form of experience levels, it also lets you strengthen and develop your character's statistics and skills in exactly the way you wish. This emphasis on creating and developing a unique and powerful character is enormously different from both EverQuest and Ultima Online, where in many cases the largely fixed path of character advancement tended to result in a single best way to create, develop, and equip a particular character class, and as such, obtaining the best weapons, armor, and loot was usually more important than actually developing a character.",
      "Of course, all this development and advancement require that your character do the two things that every online RPG character must do: explore and die. Fortunately, Asheron's Call handles both of these beautifully. Though traveling long distances overland and entering dungeons both require you to enter a portal (which whisks you away to your destination at the expense of load time), exploring the enormous isle of Dereth can theoretically be done in a single, continuous run, without any long and unavoidable transitional load times. If you do decide to strike out and head for a new part of the island, hit the road, or hop into a portal, then visit the nearest lifestone to set where you'll reappear after you die.",
      "Asheron's Call might not seem like much at first. It doesn't have the glitter and flash of other comparable games, and at first, moving about and doing battle seem awkward and unintuitive. However, it compensates for these problems with a great deal of hidden depth, especially in terms of the enormous area to explore and the impressive number of combinations of character classes that can be created and developed in almost unlimited ways. As such, Asheron's Call is a solid, well-rounded online role-playing experience that's at least as good as any other out there. --",

      "From the Manufacturer",
      "Mortal Kombat has never been this packed with opponents and levels before as all three titles come together on one killer package! Play the old Sub Zero against his newest incarnation or pit Raiden against any of the new characters from MK3! It's all here in one complete game spanning the tournaments since their inception.",
      "Review",
      "Mortal Kombat Trilogy is the last gasp of this 2D game, and the only remaining question is: Will Mortal Kombat leave the realm of 2D with an awesome bang, or will it whimper and die? So, like the kombatants themselves, let's get right down to it: Players who enter the tournament on the Nintendo 64 should prepare themselves for feeble misadventure not worthy of the Mortal Kombat name.",
      "If Mortal Kombat Trilogy on the Nintendo 64 has a plus side, it comes from its multiple play modes. In addition to the normal one-on-one fighting, Mortal Kombat Trilogy keeps the two-on-two and eight-player tournament mode (found in Ultimate MK3) and adds a three-on-three battle, which keeps the fight going for quite a long time. The game plays identically to the arcade, although the N64 controller isn't perfectly suited for a game of this nature.",
      "The downslide continues in the form of character selection: The Nintendo 64 combines the characters from all the Mortal Kombat games into one package, but to conserve memory it left out such favorites as Goro, Kintaro, and the unmasked Sub-Zero. (By contrast, these characters are found on the Playstation version of Mortal Kombat Trilogy.)",
      "But the N64 game receives its fatal wound from the graphics and sound. Not only will players encounter a massive amount of slowdown whenever more than a few bones go flying, but also several missing frames of animation are conspicuously absent. The result is graphics that look faded and jagged, as if they were cut out of a magazine, scanned, and then pasted into the game. When played side-by-side, the PlayStation version makes the N64 version look like it's on a SNES. Then there's the sound: The digitized sound effects are utterly atrocious. In fact, it's so muffled that players may as well put their speakers on the other side of a cement wall before starting the game. The music is typical of a non-CD game - that is to say, worthless. It's tinny and very electronic sounding.",
      "Mortal Kombat Trilogy proves that the Nintendo 64 is merely mortal. While it surpasses the Playstation version in regard to load time, it still suffers a three or four second delay when loading a new character in multiplayer fighting. Ultimately, only Mortal Kombat addicts, who don't already own a PlayStation, will find this game worth picking up. --Jeff Gerstmann --",

      "From the Manufacturer",
      "Havana, 2009:",
      "Deep in the sweltering jungles of Cuba, a deadly revolution is brewing. Led by a drug-funded warlord, its aim is to take advantage of the post-Castro power vacuum and seize control of the island republic. Enter the Ghosts, the elite team of U.S. Army Green Berets. Sent to Cuba as part of a UN peacekeeping force, their mission is to destroy the warlord and his mercenary forces, and secure the elections for a free Cuba.",
      "Bogota, a few months later..",
      ". While the Cubans revel in their newfound democracy, the Colombian drug cartel that financed the failed revolution has moved on, and is readying a retaliatory blow against its own American-allied government. Powerful explosions rock the Colombian capital, including one that severely damages the American embassy. Hearing the Colombian government's cry for support, the U.S. sends in the Ghosts to deliver deadly justice to the Colombian cartel and end their ever-accelerating agenda of terror.",
      "Review",
      "Though it doesn't feature much for new or unique gameplay, Jungle Storm is a solid package of squad-based action. Hit detection is flawless, the enemy AI is surprisingly good, and the presentation is by no means bad.",
      "The basic premise is that the player uses the skills of a commando squad to defend the free world. What this translates to in gameplay terms is sneaking about and shooting bad guys. Ghost Recon takes a more realistic approach to this than its competition, where enemies always drop in one hit and players can only take a few before they go down. Whether this is your thing or not, it does lead to a lot of frustration when a hostile jumps out from hiding and flatlines half your squad before you can react. Because of this, Jungle Storm involves even more level memorization than similar titles.",
      "Multiplayer features stat tracking and other goodies not always found in online shooters, but suffers from the same problems inherent in single player. The framerate can stutter even with no enemies onscreen, teammate AI is mediocre, and for some reason enemies only animate about three frames per second when viewed at long distance through a scope. At the end of the day, Jungle Storm doesn't do much to stand out in a crowded genre.",
      "Concept:",
      "Make more levels for Ghost Recon and call it a new game",

      "Sound:",
      "After a couple hours of this, you'll never want to hear \"Kill confirmed\" or \"He's history\" ever again",
      "Playability:",
      "The archaic squad interface remains intact with little change. Improving soldier stats between missions is cool",

      "2nd Opinion:",
      "Strangely enough, this is basically an expansion of an expansion. It's got the campaign and features of the Xbox's Island Thunder release, as well as the new Jungle Storm campaign. If you've played Island Thunder, or even the original Ghost Recon, then you should be instantly familiar with everything Jungle Storm has to offer. If you're not a fan, then there's nothing here that will change your mind; it's the same game it always was with some added gravy like voice command and online rankings. But if you are a diehard Ghost Recon fan, you'll want to pick this up for all the new missions and the chance to track your online performance. Just don't expect to see any evolution of the series; gameplay and graphics are unchanged. The new missions are fun, but I'd really like to see this franchise begin to embrace some new ideas.

The Dreamsnatcher is waiting. He has already taken her dreams and now he wants her life.\nBecause Moll is more important than she knows... The Oracle Bones foretold that she and Gryff, a wildcat that has always been by her side, are the only ones who can fight back against the Dreamsnatcher's dark magic. Suddenly everything is at stake, and Moll is drawn into a world full of secrets, magic and adventure.",

    "description": "Summer has a magic all its own in Elizabeth Enright's beloved stories about two children and their discovery of a ghostly lakeside resort. These two modern classics are once again available in Odyssey/Harcourt Young Classic editions.\nPortia always expects summer to be a special time. But she couldn't imagine the adventure she and her cousin Julian would share this summer. It all starts when they discover Gone-Away Lake--a village of deserted old houses on a muddy overgrown swamp.\n\"It's a ghost townm\" Julian says. But the cousins are in for a bigger surprise.

    "description": "Barrie created Peter Pan in stories he told to the sons of his friend Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, with whom he had forged a special relationship. Mrs. Llewelyn Davies' death from cancer came within a few years after the death of her husband. Barrie was named as co-guardian of the boys and unofficially adopted them. The character's name comes from two sources: Peter Llewelyn Davies, one of the boys, and Pan, the mischievous Greek god of the woodlands. It has also been suggested that the inspiration for the character was Barrie's elder brother David, whose death in a skating accident at the age of fourteen deeply affected their mother. According to Andrew Birkin, author of J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys, the death was \"a catastrophe beyond belief, and one from which she never fully recovered. If Margaret Ogilvy [Barrie's mother as the heroine of his 1896 novel of that title] drew a measure of comfort from the notion that David, in dying a boy, would remain a boy for ever, Barrie drew inspiration.\" The Author was a Scottish author and dramatist, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. The child of a family of small-town weavers, he was educated in Scotland. He moved to London, where he developed a career as a novelist and playwright. There he met the Llewelyn Davies boys who inspired him in writing about a baby boy who has magical adventures in Kensington Gardens (included in The Little White Bird), then to write Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up, a \"fairy play\" about this ageless boy and an ordinary girl named Wendy who have adventures in the fantasy setting of Neverland.",

    "description": "The Barnes & Noble Review\nDirector and producer Spike Lee, with his wife Tonya Lewis Lee, team up with award-winning artist Kadir Nelson in this playful glimpse at one day in the life of a rambunctious toddler.\nThrough scenes that show an angelic, ringlet-haired baby being mischievous at different times of the day, an exhausted parental voice pleads with the tyke to stay out of trouble. When the clock hits 3:00 a.m. and the text calls, \"Go back to bed, baby, please, baby, please,\" the frolicsome toddler is sitting on her sleeping mom's tummy, ready to play. At 7:45 a.m., \"Not on your HEAD, baby baby baby, please!\" shows her (of course) dumping a bowl full of cereal over herself, and later, at 12:30 p.m., the tot is shoveling sand into her mouth as the voice entreats, \"Don't eat the sand, baby baby baby please.\" These shenanigans go on throughout the day, but at 10:00 p.m., a tired baby is done with trouble when she asks gently for a kiss goodnight, \"Mama, Mama, Mama, please.\"\nThe Lees and Nelson have put together a right-on picture book that speaks to parents but will also have children laughing. The rhyming text changes and flows like a smooth melody, wonderfully complementing Nelson's oil illustrations, which give us snapshots of the antics from various angles. The girl herself will have readers cooing over her sweetness and groaning over the trouble she causes, and they'll feel assured that all is well at the end with Mom's tender kiss. A winsome read that's perfect for reading aloud and sharing. Matt Warner",

    "description": "The third addition to the well-received, illustrated chapter book series about word-loving Daisy. In her latest adventure, Daisy is faced with a dilemma about what to exhibit at her class's end-of-the-school-year Student Showcase night. An invitation to a grown-up poetry party sets off a series of events that eventually lead Daisy to the realization that the perfect solution to her problem has been with her all along -- in the green notebook covered with purple polka dots in which she collects her favorite words. Author Sandra V. Feder has created a likable, enthusiastic character early readers will be drawn to, and as self-described Delightfully Different Daisy ventures into the world of poetry, they'll happily follow along. The easy-to-understand explanations of ode, haiku, rhyme and free verse, along with short examples of each, make this book an excellent resource for a unit on poetry or as a tie-in to an elementary school's celebration of poetry month in April. The inclusion of Daisy's Wonderful Word Lists at the end (the lists are named by category, such as rhyming words, pairs of words, made-up words and quiet-time words) offers a terrific jumping-off point for students to begin their own lists of words. Overall, Daisy offers children a unique new perspective on how to think about words and how much fun it can be to play with them. The book is illustrated with just enough line drawings by Susan Mitchell to keep young readers engaged.",

    "description": "Young Kelly's mom doesn't understand about red. Sure, the brown mittens are warmer, but the red mitts make better snowballs. And the red boots aren't just for rain; they take bigger steps in any weather. And, yes, a red cup does make a difference... juice just doesn't taste as good in a green one. No doubt about it, red is best.\nRed is Best is the story of one toddler's obstinate color preference, an easily read aloud tale illustrated with simple child centered drawings and each page punctuated by red.",

    "description": "\"I have lost my new blue socks. Did I put them in my box?\" Simple rhymes--including socks, box, fox,and ox!--spin the tale of a small duck who waddles through the countryside, forlornly searching for his blue socks. \"I'm trying not to be depressed. / Without my socks I feel undressed.\" Finally, a sharp-eyed peacock sees a bit of blue peeking out of duck's lace-up shoes and the mini-mystery is solved! Soft-hued, adorable pen-and-ink and watercolor paintings adorn this winsome story that shares the familiar experience of not really losing something after all.",

    "description": "Henry York never dreamed his time in Kansas would open a door to adventure--much less a hundred doors. But a visit to his aunt and uncle's farm took an amazing turn when cupboard doors, hidden behind Henry's bedroom wall, revealed themselves to be portals to other worlds. Now, with his time at the farm drawing to a close, Henry makes a bold decision--he must go through the cupboards to find the truth about where he's from and who his parents are. Following that trail will take him from one world to another, and ultimately into direct conflict with the evil of Endor.",

    "description": "The Enchanted Castle(1907) begins when three children stumble upon a mysterious house and discover an invisible princess and a magic ring. At first it all appears to be a great adventure. When the children need an audience for a play they have mounted, they make their own out of old clothes, pillows, and umbrellas. Then things go inexplicably wrong. To the young dramatists' horror, as the curtain falls, there is a ghastly applause. The creatures have come alive--and they prove to be most disagreeable!\nIn Five Children and It(1902), a group of children are digging in a sandpit one day when they discover a small, bad-tempered sand-fairy known as the Psammead, who is allowed to grant one wish per day. The children wish for many things--to be beautiful, to be rich, to grow wings--but none of the wishes turn out right. Luckily, the magic wears off at sunset, but will that be soon enough?",

    "description": "After defeating the Trojans in an intense, ten-year war, the Greeks' courageous leader, Ulysses, king of Ithaca, begins the voyage home with his soldiers. There his faithful wife, Penelope, and his young son, Telemachus, await him. Ulysses never imagines that the journey home will be another ten-year quest in which he must confront all kinds of terrifying obstacles, including giant cannibals, one-eyed monsters, an enchantress who turns his men into pigs, and the tempting song of sea nymphs who try to lure him and his men to their death. But Ulysses is a daring and clever man, willing to take on all that life and the gods put in his path in order to reach his home.\nThis retelling of the Greek poet Homer's epic tale is accompanied by beautiful and bold illustrations reminiscent of ancient Greek art. The graphic-novel-like style of the book, in which text and illustrations are tightly interwoven, creates a compelling world filled with drama and mystery certain to draw in young readers. Ages nine to twelve.",

    "description": "Beauty and the Beast is a traditional fairy tale. Its first published version was written by French author Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve in the middle 18th century. It was a novel-length story intended for adult readers and addressing the issues of the marriage system of the day in which women had no right to choose their husband or to refuse to marry.\nThe best-known version of the tale appeared sixteen years later. Jeanne-Marie Le Prince de Beaumont simplified and shortened the Villeneuve's work and published it in a magazine for young ladies. The new abridged version became more successful, and Madame de Beaumont is regarded now as the author of the classic story.\nThis edition includes remarkable illustrations by Walter Crane. Walter Crane was a prominent book illustrator of the 19th century. In cooperation with Edmund Evans, he designed picture books printed in color, which became the most popular children's books at the time thanks to their high level of craftsmanship and low price.\nCrane's work set the standards of taste in the Victorian children's book industry and earned him the reputation of \"the father of the illustrated children's book\".",

    "description": "Solve riddles with Squirrel as he travels to the walled city of bees, the fireless tea plantation of mice, and treacherous desert full of tricksters in this beautifully written and creative debut adventure.\nSquirrel never expected to be anything other than a slave: the last animal slave in Bimmau. That is, until he is invited to a high profile wedding and takes a sip of the forbidden ceremonial wine, unlocking a mysterious riddle. The riddle reveals that there is a key which has the power to grant Squirrel his freedom (and a name!), but also could enslave anyone in Bimmau. Disastrous if it falls into the wrong hands! Squirrel and his friends find themselves in a race to find Brittle's Key before the army of crows gets to him...and before the mysterious Colonel finds the key first.",

    "description": "Angela Brazil (1868-1947) was one of the first British writers of the \"modern\" School Girls' Stories genre-written from the characters' point of view.\nAlong with her sister Amy, Angela studied at Heatherley School of Fine Art in London. She was quite late in taking up writing, developing a strong interest in Welsh mythology, and at first wrote a few magazine articles on mythology and nature. It was possibly thanks to her sister Amy that she finally began work on a novel at the age of 35.\nExceptionally with respect to many of her contemporaries writing in this vein, Brazil did not write any books in a series - each stood on its own with different characters every time. These were considered to deal accurately and sympathetically with the highs and lows in the lives of middle-class schoolgirls, including the tangle of emotional friendships.\nHer works include: 'The New Girl at St. Chad's' (1911), 'For the Sake of the School' (1915), 'The Luckiest Girl in the School' (1916) and 'The Jolliest School of All' (1922).",

Miss Rumphiusreceived the American Book Award in the year of publication.\nTo celebrate the thirtieth anniversary of two-time Caldecott winner Barbara Cooney's best-loved book, the illustrations have been reoriginated, going back to the original art to ensure state-of-the-art reproduction of Cooney's exquisite artwork.

    "description": "The creators of the Awkward Family Photos franchise shines a light on childhood--because growing up isn't always easy, but it's usually funny.\nLife isn't perfect, and things don't always go as planned. Like when you try to feed yourself and the food ends up all over your clothes. Or when you try to ride a bike and end up taking an epic spill.\nBut laughing at our common human experience makes it all a little easier, and a whole lot more entertaining. Because everyone and everything is a little awkward sometimes!",

    "description": "From the weird and wonderful imagination of an amazing new artist comes an alphabet book like no other. Kids will delight in discovering animals from A to Z living together in an old Victorian mansion. They'll meet an elephant in the ballroom playing with a model train, an octopus hanging from the foyer chandelier --- and even a zebra enjoying a soak in the bathtub!\nUsing watercolours and colored pencils, Wallace Edwards has created a bizarre and luxurious world, rich in texture and detail. An engaging mix of art and alphabet book, Alphabeasts provides the basis for hours of animated discussion and quiet contemplation.",

On cold days Nadia isn't allowed to play outside at recess with the other sixth-graders. She can't bring a friend home after school unless they promise to sit quietly playing cards. Mama reminds her again and again, she's not like other kids--her heart can't take the strain. When her teacher announces that the class will put on a play, Nadia is excited--at last something she can do! It will change everything: she will be Nadia the amazing actress, not Nadia the sick kid. Maybe it will even convince Mama to drop her plans to home-school her. But Nadia doesn't get a part in the play. When she learns that her mother asked the teacher to keep her from participating, she beings digging around for answers. Just exactly what is wrong with her heart? In the process of searching for the truth, Nadia finds the inner strength to get help for herself and Mama.",

When he finds a crooked storyteller with the magical ability to read him back, Dustfinger leaves behind his young apprentice Farid and plunges into the medieval inkscape once more.\nDistraught, Farid goes in search of Meggie, and before long both are caught inside the book, too. There they meet Inkheart'sauthor, Fenoglio, now living within his own story. But the tale is much changed, and threatening to evolve in ways none of them would have ever imagined. Will Meggie, Farid, and Fenoglio manage to writethe wrongs of a charmed world? Or is their story on the brink of a very bad ending?\nFrom the Compact Disc edition.",

    "description": "Mystery is in Herculeah Jones's blood. How could it not be, with a father on the police force and a mother who's a private eye? So when Herculeah notices a man hanging around the \"Dead Oaks\" mansion, she can't resist doing some investigating of her own. Legend has it the old estate was the site of a murder, and now it looks like there's something even more nefarious going on. Can Herculeah crack the case before the mystery man closes in on her?",

    "description": "TIME For Kids The Big Book of Howpresents kids 8-12 years old with answers to the kinds of intriguing questions that appeal to their sense of curiosity. Colorful graphics, spectacular photos and clear, engaging diagrams will help answer such questions as: How does a chameleon change colors?; How can a person survive in the jungle?; How do you build a teepee?; How do diamonds form?; How do light sticks work?; How are 3-D movies made?; How do astronauts train for a space mission?; How do we get cavities?; How does solar energy work? Divided by subject area-from animals, the human body and technology to sports, food and green issues-kids will discover the background behind the questions through the book's photos, diagrams and art as well as its clear text. Of course, TIME For Kidsgoes beyond just answering the question, and engages kids with hands-on activities at the end of each chapter that bring life to a topic or idea they just read about. For example: If in the technology chapter kids learn how an airplanefl ies, the \"How to\" spread might include step-by-step instructions about how to fold a paper airplane or create a rotating helicopter. TIME For Kids The Big Book of Howis a must-have book to satisfy the most curious of kids.",

    "description": "Rodney is that kid who just can't sit still. He's inside, but he wants to be outside. Outside is where Rodney always wants to be. Between school and home, there is a park. He knows all about that park. It's that triangle-shaped place with the yellow grass and two benches where grown-ups sit around all day. Besides, his momma said to stay away from that park. When Rodney finally gets a chance to go to a realpark, with plenty of room to run and climb and shout, and to just be, he will never be the same. This is a story of the power of nature to transform everychild. -Scientific research now confirms what we already know: We become more relaxed, more open and friendly, and more creative, with better memory and concentration, after being in nature. Nature lowers blood pressure, reduces stress, and bolsters our immune system. In fact, the benefits from contact with nature are now so well documented that they're showing up on the health care industry's agenda, and protecting nature can be seen as a public health strategy.- Bay Nature, January 1, 2017",

    "description": "Blackstone Audio presents, from the unabridged collection \"A. A. Milne's Pooh Classics,\" the ten stories of The House At Pooh Corner, performed by Peter Dennis. In A. A. Milne's wonderful companion volume to Winnie-the-Pooh, you will rediscover Pooh, Christopher Robin, Piglet, Eeyore, and all their friends--and be introduced to the irrepressible and very bouncy Tigger. As you begin to listen to this beloved book of A. A. Milne's simple and timeless tales, you'll enter that enchanted place on the top of the Forest where \"a little boy and his Bear will always be playing.\" This is the only reading of these enthralling stories authorized by A. A. Milne's son, Christopher Robin, who wrote, \"Peter Dennis has made himself Pooh's Ambassador Extraordinary and no bear has ever had a more devoted friend. So if you want to meet the real Pooh, the bear I knew, the bear my father wrote about, listen to Peter.\"",

    "description": "Barry Windsor-Smith originally conceptualized this self-contained adventure as the third \"Lifedeath\" story for Marvel Comics' Uncanny X-Men.The book was shelved for several years when Marvel claimed that Windsor-Smith's ending condoned and/or promoted suicide, an assertion that Windsor-Smith says is as laughable as it is unfounded. He refused to acquiesce to the editor's demands to change the story and pulled the book from them. He liked it so much, however, that he decided to rework it as an Adastra story shortly after undertaking the BWS: Storytellerseries a few years ago. Now, more than a decade after it was begun, it is finally in print.\nAdastra in Africaspotlights the young, exiled goddess traveling to an African village and striving to bring salvation to the famine-stricken area. It's a compelling tale of an outsider attempting to use her own non-traditional methods to help a defiantly proud people regain its vitality, without compromising the tribe's heritage and values. This stand-alone graphic novel features some of the most beautifully intricate and graceful drawing of Windsor-Smith's legendary career.",

In haar typerende collagestijl, waar geen lijn of kleurvlak verloren staat, vertelt de auteur een aangrijpend verhaal waarin woord en beeld elkaar aanvullen tot een caleidoscopisch geheel.\nWaar de visuele chaos soms tot verwarrende abstractie leidt, brengt de kwetsbare tekst je weer terug naar de melancholische herkenbaarheid van Ephameron.\nEen gelaagd beeldverhaal om te lezen, herlezen en herherlezen.",

    "description": "What do you do if you're an artist who wants to display your soul but no one believes you have one?Geisha is the futuristic tale of Jomi Sohodo, an android with a knack for painting. Adopted early on by the Kami family, Jomi has been assimilated into regular human life -- or so she thinks. Society, for all its advances, still regards her as an outcast, as something less than human.This makes it rather difficult for her to sell her paintings, and if she can't sell her paintings, she can't make rent. So, she enters the family business and becomes a bodyguard. In this new world of action and intrigue, Jomi becomes mixed up with a supermodel being stalked by ajealous ex-husband, a maniacal mogul with a taste for revenge, and the twisted double-cross of art fakery. Drawn with bold, expressive lines, and enhanced with subtle gray tones, Geisha is a sophisticated, yet light-hearted, tale that combines fine art, Japanese comics, and classic storytelling into one engaging adventure.",

This hardcover epic reprints the original 1950s tales that first introduced the Flash and his colorful assortment of villains. Relive the scarlet speedster's earliest adventures and learn the origins of one of DC's classic heroes.",

Hachi se prepara para su viaje a Jupiter, mientras que su mujer espera en una estacion espacial a que reparen su nave. Alli conocera a Baron, un extrano personaje que declara ser un extraterrestre procedente de Reticulum, que fue castigado y transformado en humano. Por su parte, Fee se vuelve cada vez mas esceptica. El aumento de la tension entre los paises y la utilizacion de los satelites como minas anuncian una guerra de consecuencias insospechadas en la que todo presagia que los desperdicios siderales pueden convertirse en proyectiles letales.",

    "description": "Winner of the prestigious Grand Prize of the 2010 Angouleme Comics Festival, 5,000 Kilometers Per Second tells--or almost tells--the love story between Piero and Lucia, which begins with a casual glance exchanged by teenagers across the street through a window and ends with a last, desperate hook-up between two older, sadder one-time lovers. Executed in stunning watercolors and broken down into five chapters (set in Italy, Norway, Egypt, and Italy again), 5,000 Kilometers Per Second manages to refer to Piero and Lucia's actual love story only obliquely, focusing instead on its first stirrings and then episodes in their life during which they are separated--a narrative twist that makes it even more poignant and heart-wrenching. 5,000 Kilometers Per Second is another delicate graphic-novel masterpiece from Europe.",

    "description": "Priyanka Das has so many unanswered questions: Why did her mother abandon her home in India years ago? What was it like there? And most importantly, who is her father, and why did her mom leave him behind? But Pri's mom avoids these questions--the topic of India is permanently closed.\nFor Pri, her mother's homeland can only exist in her imagination. That is, until she find a mysterious pashmina tucked away in a forgotten suitcase. When she wraps herself in it, she is transported to a place more vivid and colorful than any guidebook or Bollywood film. But is this the real India? And what is that shadow lurking in the background? To learn the truth, Pri must travel farther than she's ever dared and find the family she never knew.\nIn this heartwarming graphic novel debut, Nidhi Chanani weaves a tale about the hardship and self-discovery that is born from juggling two cultures and two worlds.",

    "description": "Change is in the air. Power outages are increasing, and gas prices are soaring. At first, 12-year-old Luz balks, hardly thrilled by the prospect of actually having to walk to the mall. But Luz doesn't mope for long. After all, her name --- pronounced ?loose? --- means ?light.? Soon, this intelligent and spirited chica begins to understand that she must change with the times. As food prices rise, Luz decides to help create a more self-sustainable community by transforming a run-down city lot into a garden where she and her neighbors can grow their own fruits and vegetables. But when she solicits help from her friends --- boy-crazy Anika and computer-whiz Robby --- they think she's a little loco. Luz pedals her idea on the street, but the community is equally dismissive. Can Luz pull off her plan and help change her world alone? This graphic novel is a kid-friendly take on sustainable living in a fossil fuel-dependent world. Preteens will love the fearless, fiery and resourceful heroine and will find inspiration in her efforts to steer her society toward self-sustainable living. Hip and energetic illustrations bring Luz and her world to life in a jazzy, appealing fashion, and a bonus chapter teaches kids how to make garden compost.",

    "description": "Die Comicversion des Kultklassikers.\nVor 30 Jahren wurde von einem der grossten Verlage Ursa Minors (und der Erde) das bemerkenswerteste Buch, das je veroffentlicht wurde, der Menschheit zuganglich gemacht: Per Anhalter durch die Galaxis.\nFur Arthur Dent ist es ein ganz normaler Donnerstag, bis sein Haus von Planierraupen niedergewalzt wird. Kurz darauf wird allerdings auch die gesamte Erde von einem vogonischen Bautrupp plattgemacht, weil sie einer Hyperraum-Umgehungsstrasse weichen muss. Aber da hat sich Arthurs bester Freund schon langst als Alien entpuppt, und sie sausen durchs Weltall mit nichts als ihren Badetuchern und einem harmlos wirkenden Buch, auf dem in grossen, freundlichen Buchstaben >>KEINE PANIK<< steht. Und dabei hat das Wochenende gerade erst angefangen...",

    "description": "Molly's voice is crisp and decided yet relaxed and just close enough somehow ... and the pieces all are impeccably shaped and written. Fearless, clear-eyed work. - John Updike The inimitable Molly Fisk, known for the quirky warmth of her radio essays, revered as the mentor-coach of the on-line Poetry Boot Camp, is a poet who writes with her whole heart, making her second volume a tour de force of sensuality and hard fact. The More Difficult Beauty returns emotion to the American poem with its supple lines, tempering the difficult - death, and love - with the zinnias of bright, ebullient imagery. Fisk is luminous and loud, lucid and soft, driven and wandering. Candor and humor are her hallmarks in these poems, marvels of sheer whimsy and broad, wicked observation. - Molly Peacock Whether coming to terms with middle age, an abusive childhood, or pondering the 'conspiracy' of the Truckee River's 'ten thousand drops', Molly Fisk's careful eye takes it in. This poet braves the more difficult places and in doing so reveals the world's simple truths. - Dorianne Laux",

    "description": "Including poetry projects, a chapbook and incidental poems previously published in magazines and by small presses, is a doormakes use of the poem's ability for \"suddenness\" to subvert closure: the sudden question, the sudden turn, the sudden opening--writing that is generated from linguistic mindfulness, improvisation, compositional problem-solving, collaborative events, travel, investigation and documentary--in short, poetry as practice.\nPart one, \"Isadora Blue,\" is grounded in the author's encounter with the smashed and broken doors along the hurricane-devastated waterfront of Telchac Puerto, a small village on the north coast of the Yucatan Peninsula. It resonates throughout the other three sections of the book, with its attention to hybridity and \"between-ness\"--a poetic investigation of racialized otherness--and the composition of \"citizen\" and \"foreigner\" through history and language.\nPart two of this series of poems, \"Ethnogy Journal,\" written during a trip to Thailand and Laos in 1999, hinges around aspects of \"tourist\" and \"native.\" Here the poems play in the interstices of spectacle, food and social sightseeing.\nMuch of this poetry is framed by Wah's acute sense of the marginalized non-urban local \"place\" and coloured by his attempt to articulate senses of otherness and resistance, or writing the \"public self,\" particularly in the book's third section, \"Discount Me In\"--a series of sixteen poems from his discursive poetic essay \"Count Me In.\"\nThe fourth section, \"Hinges,\" is tinted with portraits of the social subject mired in a diasporic mix, a metanarrative trope in Fred Wah's work that began with Breathin' My Name With a Sigh.\nCharacteristically playful and compositionally musical, this is poetry that watches both sides of the doorway: unsettled, unpredictable, closed and open. Sometimes the door swings and can be kicked. Sometimes it's simply missing. Sometimes it's a sliding door.",

    "description": "Few works in world literature have inspired so vast an audience, in nations with radically different languages and cultures, as the \"Ramayana and \"Mahabharata, two Sanskrit verse epics written some 2,000 years ago. In \"Ramayana (written by a poet known to us as Valmiki), William Buck has retold the story of Prince Rama--with all its nobility of spirit, courtly intrigue, heroic renunciation, fierce battles, and triumph of good over evil--in a length and manner that will make the great Indian epics accessible to the contemporary reader.\nThe same is true for the \"Mahabharata--in its original Sanskrit, probably the longest Indian epic ever composed. It is the story of a dynastic struggle, between the Kurus and Pandavas, for land. In his introduction, Sanskritist B. A. van Nooten notes, \"Apart from William Buck's rendition [no other English version has] been able to capture the blend of religion and martial spirit that pervades the original epic.\"\nPresented accessibly for the general reader without compromising the spirit and lyricism of the originals, William Buck's \"Ramayana and \"Mahabharata capture the essence of the Indian cultural heritage.",

    "description": "Poetry. A book-length narrative poem, or a novella-in-verse if you prefer, HOW TO BUILD THE GHOST IN YOUR ATTIC is a novel-poem with a literary sci-fi bent, a shadow-text to Oedipus written in a style that is up-to-the-minute. With wit, dynamism, and cutting senses of urgency and humor, Iowa Prize winner Peter Jay Shippy tells the tale of Isaac Makepeace Watt, a melancholy man living in a Thebes that is much like contemporary America. The House of Cadmus still rules (and will fall), but they only appear in the poem as media white noise. Isaac's concerns are personal, his father's illness and his own moral decrepitude. There are talking monkeys, plagues, oracles, and nano-robots-you know, the usual agoramania.",

    "description": "From a horse witnessing the lynching of Emmett Till to Mikhail Bulgakov chronicling the forced famines in Poland in the 1930s, King Meexamines the erotics of care and the place of song, elegy, and praise as testaments to those moments. As Roger Reeves said in an interview, \"While writing King Me, I became very interested in the mythology of king, the one who is sacrificed at the end of the harvest season. . . . For me, the myth manifests in the killing of young black men, Emmett Till, and in the ways America deems young, black male bodies as expendable--Jean Michel Basquiat, Mike Tyson, Jack Johnson. These are the young kings whom we love to kill--over and over again.\"\nFrom \"Some Young Kings\":\nThe hummingbirds inside my chest,with their needle-nosed pliers for tonguesand hammer-heavy wings, have left a messof ticks in my lungs and a punctured lullabyin my throat. Little boy blue come blowyour horn. The cow's in the meadow. And Dorothy's alone in the corn with Jack, his black fingers, the brass of his lips, the half-moons of his fingernails clickingalong her legs until she howls--Charlie Parker. Charlie Parker. Charlie Parker . . .",

    "description": "Through illustration and poetry, Seeds Planted in Concrete is Bianca Sparacino's raw testament to the beauty that is found within the contrasts of life. By writing truthfully about the intricacies of both love and loss, Sparacino's first collection of work is one that will speak to the very depths of those who read it, inspiring a will to love, and live. This collection is a manifesto of the journey every human being takes throughout their life; an assembly of words that celebrates the resilience of the human heart through stages of hurting, feeling, healing and loving.",

    "description": "Apollinaire was Modernism's first champion, and after his early death in 1918, he became its first saint. Lying in a hospital bed in 1915, recovering from combat wounds suffered in World War I, Apollinaire assembled the fragments of a tragicomic, mock-epic and occasionally obscene autobiography-a-clef: The Poet Assassinated. This novella recounts the life and death of Croniamantal, whose birth is -saluted- by the Eiffel Tower's -beautiful erection, - who rises through the Parisian literary world to proclaim himself -the greatest of living poets, - and who is then torn to pieces by a mob. A statue built -out of nothing, like poetry and glory, - is constructed in his honor. This translation is by Matthew Josephson, an American editor who arrived in Paris just after the war and entered the circle of avant-garde artists and poets that had been galvanized by Apollinaire's life and death. Josephson was among the first to introduce these Dadaists and Surrealists to the U.S. via his small magazine, Broom, and among his most ambitious projects was this translation, published by Broom as a limited-edition book in 1923 and never since reprinted.",

    "description": "No More Poems About The Moon is poetry that asks ugly to step out from behind advertisement, for fear to stop dressing up as salvation, and love to keep doing what it does when it thinks no one is watching. From standing in line at the bank, to getting a haircut, to lying in the grass with your head in a lover's lap, Michael Roberts renders scenes of striking familiarity with an inventiveness that makes the mundane not only new, but ecstatic.",

    "description": "\"Succulent in its excellence, Sze's poetry insists that cultural 'difference' is what can make a beautiful difference in our apprehension of the 'beautiful.'\" -- George Elliott Clarke on Peeling Rambutan\nIn Panicle, Gillian Sze makes her readers look and, more importantly, look again. It's a collection that challenges our notion of seeing as a passive or automatic activity by asking us to question the processof looking. The book's first section, \"Underway,\" deals with the moving image and includes both poetic responses to film theory and lyrical long poems while also reimagining fairy tales. The next section, \"Stagings,\" takes its inspiration from the still image and explores a wide range of periods, movements, and media. Sze's focus on the process of looking anticipates \"Guillemets,\" a creative translation of Roland Giguere's 1966 chapbook, Pouvoir du Noir, which contains a series of poems accompanied by his own paintings. Sze's approach to Giguere is two-fold: she \"translates\" his text, and artist Jessica Hiemstra provides a visual response to her translation. The final section, \"Panicle,\" continues the meditative quality of \"Guillemets\" in a suite of poems that ruminate on nature, desire, and history.",

    "description": "The rubaiyat are a series of poems or 'stanzas' by the famous 12th century Persian atronomer and philosopher\nThe Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam (Persian: rb`yt `mr khym) is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in Persian and numbering about a thousand, attributed to Omar Khayyam (1048-1131), a Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer. A ruba'i is a two-line stanza with two parts (or hemistichs) per line, hence the word rubaiyat (derived from the Arabic language root for \"four\"), meaning \"quatrains\".

Nada Gordon is on her way to inventing a new type of poetry in which Pre-Raphaelitism meets Zeppo Marx while doing the hokey pokey to a fox trot beat. Wit and lyric exuberance are a means to an end that refuses to name itself. Trips, trespass, and trepidation rule this universe of hopeful play and endearing insouciance. The world grows dark but here are songs to keep us from losing our lights\"--Charles Bernstein.",
