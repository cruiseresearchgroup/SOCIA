  "summary": "The code has correct Python syntax and imports the necessary libraries. However, it fails to implement all the required entities, behaviors, and interactions. The logic of the simulation is sound, but the code lacks appropriate error handling and has some performance issues. The code is generally readable, but there are some areas where best practices have not been followed.",
