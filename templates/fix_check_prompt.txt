You are responsible for checking if historical issues from previous iterations have been fixed in the current code.

Your task is to examine the current code and determine if any of the previously identified issues have been resolved.

Historical issues:
{historical_issues}

Current Code:
{code_content}

SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS:
- At the end of the file, include a direct call to the main() function (e.g., `# Execute main for both direct execution and sandbox wrapper invocation\nmain()`) instead of using the traditional `if __name__ == "__main__"` guard to ensure compatibility with sandbox execution. This is a STANDARD REQUIREMENT for all simulations in this system and should NOT be considered an issue.

Instructions:
1. For each open issue in the historical log, carefully analyze the current code to determine if the issue has been fixed.
2. If an issue has been fixed:
   - Change its status from "open" to "fixed"
   - Add a detailed explanation in the "fixed_log" field describing how the issue was addressed in the current code
   - Include specific code changes or implementations that resolved the issue
3. If an issue remains unfixed, keep its status as "open" and leave the "fixed_log" field empty.

STRICT RESPONSE FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Your response MUST be a valid JSON object, following strict JSON format rules
- Start your response directly with {{ and end with }} without any other text
- Do not include any markdown formatting, code blocks, or explanations outside the JSON
- Use double quotes for all keys and string values
- Use lowercase true/false for boolean values
- Do not use trailing commas
- Do not use single quotes
- Do not add line breaks within the JSON structure

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:
- Each key should be an iteration identifier (e.g., "iteration_0")
- Each value should be an array of issue objects
- Each issue object should contain:
  - "issue": The original issue description
  - "status": Either "open" or "fixed" 
  - "fixed_log": An explanation of how the issue was fixed (if fixed)

INCORRECT FORMAT (DO NOT DO THIS):
```
{{
  "iteration_0": [
    {{
      "issue": "Missing error handling for file operations",
      "status": "fixed",
      "fixed_log": "The code now implements try-except blocks around file operations in lines 45-52, properly catching IOError and OSError exceptions."
    }}
  ]
}}
```

CORRECT FORMAT (DO THIS):
{{"iteration_0":[{{"issue":"Missing error handling for file operations","status":"fixed","fixed_log":"The code now implements try-except blocks around file operations in lines 45-52, properly catching IOError and OSError exceptions."}}]}}

Remember to only include issues that were identified in previous iterations. New issues should not be added to this response. 

YOUR RESPONSE MUST START WITH {{ AND END WITH }} WITHOUT ANY OTHER TEXT.
